&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;article-body-blocks&quot;&gt;
	    &lt;p&gt;A top secret National Security Agency program allows analysts to search with no prior authorization through vast databases containing emails, online chats and the browsing histories of millions of individuals, according to documents provided by whistleblower Edward Snowden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/world/nsa&quot; title=&quot;More from guardian.co.uk on NSA&quot;&gt;NSA&lt;/a&gt; boasts in training materials that the program, called XKeyscore, is its &quot;widest reaching&quot; system for developing intelligence from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/internet&quot; title=&quot;More from guardian.co.uk on Internet&quot;&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest revelations will add to the intense public and congressional debate around the extent of NSA &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/world/surveillance&quot; title=&quot;More from guardian.co.uk on Surveillance&quot;&gt;surveillance&lt;/a&gt; programs. They come as senior intelligence officials testify to the Senate judiciary committee on Wednesday, releasing classified documents in response to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files&quot;&gt;the Guardian's earlier stories&lt;/a&gt; on bulk collection of phone records and Fisa surveillance court oversight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The files shed light on one of Snowden's most controversial statements, made in his first video interview published by the Guardian on June 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I, sitting at my desk,&quot; said Snowden, could &quot;wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant, to a federal judge or even the president, if I had a personal email&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US officials vehemently denied this specific claim. Mike Rogers, the Republican chairman of the House intelligence committee, said of Snowden's assertion: &quot;He's lying. It's impossible for him to do what he was saying he could do.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But training materials for XKeyscore detail how analysts can use it and other systems to mine enormous agency databases by filling in a simple on-screen form giving only a broad justification for the search. The request is not reviewed by a court or any NSA personnel before it is processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;XKeyscore, the documents boast, is the NSA's &quot;widest reaching&quot; system developing intelligence from computer networks &amp;#x2013; what the agency calls Digital Network Intelligence (DNI). One presentation claims the program covers &quot;nearly everything a typical user does on the internet&quot;, including the content of emails, websites visited and searches, as well as their metadata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts can also use XKeyscore and other NSA systems to obtain ongoing &quot;real-time&quot; interception of an individual's internet activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under US law, the NSA is required to obtain an individualized Fisa warrant only if the target of their surveillance is a 'US person', though no such warrant is required for intercepting the communications of Americans with foreign targets. But XKeyscore provides the technological capability, if not the legal authority, to target even US persons for extensive electronic surveillance without a warrant provided that some identifying information, such as their email or IP address, is known to the analyst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One training slide illustrates the digital activity constantly being collected by XKeyscore and the analyst's ability to query the databases at any time.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;inline wide&quot;&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/7/31/1375269148029/KS1-001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;KS1&quot; width=&quot;460&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of XKeyscore is to allow analysts to search the metadata as well as the content of emails and other internet activity, such as browser history, even when there is no known email account (a &quot;selector&quot; in NSA parlance) associated with the individual being targeted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts can also search by name, telephone number, IP address, keywords, the language in which the internet activity was conducted or the type of browser used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One document notes that this is because &quot;strong selection [search by email address] itself gives us only a very limited capability&quot; because &quot;a large amount of time spent on the web is performing actions that are anonymous.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NSA documents assert that by 2008, 300 terrorists had been captured using intelligence from XKeyscore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts are warned that searching the full database for content will yield too many results to sift through. Instead they are advised to use the metadata also stored in the databases to narrow down what to review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A slide entitled &quot;plug-ins&quot; in a December 2012 document describes the various fields of information that can be searched. It includes &quot;every email address seen in a session by both username and domain&quot;, &quot;every phone number seen in a session (eg address book entries or signature block)&quot; and user activity &amp;#x2013; &quot;the webmail and chat activity to include username, buddylist, machine specific cookies etc&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Email monitoring&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a second Guardian interview in June, Snowden elaborated on his statement about being able to read any individual's email if he had their email address. He said the claim was based in part on the email search capabilities of XKeyscore, which Snowden says he was authorized to use while working as a Booz Allen contractor for the NSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One top-secret document describes how the program &quot;searches within bodies of emails, webpages and documents&quot;, including the &quot;To, From, CC, BCC lines&quot; and the 'Contact Us' pages on websites&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To search for emails, an analyst using XKS enters the individual's email address into a simple online search form, along with the &quot;justification&quot; for the search and the time period for which the emails are sought.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;inline wide&quot;&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/7/31/1375270036263/KS2-001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;KS2&quot; width=&quot;460&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;inline wide&quot;&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/7/31/1375269238578/KS3-001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;KS3&quot; width=&quot;460&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analyst then selects which of those returned emails they want to read by opening them in NSA reading software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system is similar to the way in which NSA analysts generally can intercept the communications of anyone they select, including, as one NSA document put it, &quot;communications that transit the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa&quot; title=&quot;More from guardian.co.uk on United States&quot;&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and communications that terminate in the United States&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One document, a top secret 2010 guide describing the training received by NSA analysts for general surveillance under the Fisa Amendments Act of 2008, explains that analysts can begin surveillance on anyone by clicking a few simple pull-down menus designed to provide both legal and targeting justifications. Once options on the pull-down menus are selected, their target is marked for electronic surveillance and the analyst is able to review the content of their communications:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;inline wide&quot;&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/7/31/1375269316245/KS4-001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;KS4&quot; width=&quot;460&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chats, browsing history and other internet activity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond emails, the XKeyscore system allows analysts to monitor a virtually unlimited array of other internet activities, including those within social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An NSA tool called DNI Presenter, used to read the content of stored emails, also enables an analyst using XKeyscore to read the content of Facebook chats or private messages.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;inline wide&quot;&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/7/31/1375269369201/KS5-001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;KS5&quot; width=&quot;460&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An analyst can monitor such Facebook chats by entering the Facebook user name and a date range into a simple search screen.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;inline wide&quot;&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/7/31/1375269436464/KS6-001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;KS6&quot; width=&quot;460&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts can search for internet browsing activities using a wide range of information, including search terms entered by the user or the websites viewed.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;inline wide&quot;&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/7/31/1375269549334/KS7-001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;KS7&quot; width=&quot;460&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one slide indicates, the ability to search HTTP activity by keyword permits the analyst access to what the NSA calls &quot;nearly everything a typical user does on the internet&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;inline wide&quot;&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/7/31/1375269604628/KS8-001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;KS8&quot; width=&quot;460&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The XKeyscore program also allows an analyst to learn the IP addresses of every person who visits any website the analyst specifies.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;inline wide&quot;&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/7/31/1375269682670/KS9-001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;KS9&quot; width=&quot;460&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quantity of communications accessible through programs such as XKeyscore is staggeringly large. One NSA report from 2007 estimated that there were 850bn &quot;call events&quot; collected and stored in the NSA databases, and close to 150bn internet records. Each day, the document says, 1-2bn records were added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;William Binney, a former NSA mathematician, said last year that the agency had &quot;assembled on the order of 20tn transactions about US citizens with other US citizens&quot;, an estimate, he said,  that &quot;only was involving phone calls and emails&quot;.&amp;#xA0;A 2010 Washington Post article reported that &quot;every day, collection systems at the [NSA] intercept and store 1.7bn emails, phone calls and other type of communications.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The XKeyscore system is continuously collecting so much internet data that it can be stored only for short periods of time. Content remains on the system for only three to five days, while metadata is stored for 30 days. One document explains: &quot;At some sites, the amount of data we receive per day (20+ terabytes) can only be stored for as little as 24 hours.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To solve this problem, the NSA has created a multi-tiered system that allows analysts to store &quot;interesting&quot; content in other databases, such as one named Pinwale which can store material for up to five years.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the databases of XKeyscore, one document shows, that now contain the greatest amount of communications data collected by the NSA.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;inline wide&quot;&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/7/31/1375269777576/KS10-001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;KS10&quot; width=&quot;460&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, there were at least 41 billion total records collected and stored in XKeyscore for a single 30-day period.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;inline&quot;&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/7/31/1375269849399/KS11-002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;KS11&quot; width=&quot;220&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legal v technical restrictions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Fisa Amendments Act of 2008 requires an individualized warrant for the targeting of US persons, NSA analysts are permitted to intercept the communications of such individuals without a warrant if they are in contact with one of the NSA's foreign targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ACLU's deputy legal director, Jameel Jaffer, told the Guardian last month that national security officials expressly said that a primary purpose of the new law was to enable them to collect large amounts of Americans' communications without individualized warrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The government doesn't need to 'target' Americans in order to collect huge volumes of their communications,&quot; said Jaffer. &quot;The government inevitably sweeps up the communications of many Americans&quot; when targeting foreign nationals for surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An example is provided by one XKeyscore document showing an NSA target in Tehran communicating with people in Frankfurt, Amsterdam and New York.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;inline wide&quot;&gt;
                &lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/7/31/1375269905543/KS12-001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;KS12&quot; width=&quot;460&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the NSA has attempted to segregate exclusively domestic US communications in separate databases. But even NSA documents acknowledge that such efforts are imperfect, as even purely domestic communications can travel on foreign systems, and NSA tools are sometimes unable to identify the national origins of communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, all communications between Americans and someone on foreign soil are included in the same databases as foreign-to-foreign communications, making them readily searchable without warrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some searches conducted by NSA analysts are periodically reviewed by their supervisors within the NSA. &quot;It's very rare to be questioned on our searches,&quot; Snowden told the Guardian in June, &quot;and even when we are, it's usually along the lines of: 'let's bulk up the justification'.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a letter this week to senator Ron Wyden, director of national intelligence James Clapper acknowledged that NSA analysts have exceeded even legal limits as interpreted by the NSA in domestic surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acknowledging what he called &quot;a number of compliance problems&quot;, Clapper attributed them to &quot;human error&quot; or &quot;highly sophisticated technology issues&quot; rather than &quot;bad faith&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Wyden said on the Senate floor on Tuesday: &quot;These violations are more serious than those stated by the intelligence community, and are troubling.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement to the Guardian, the NSA said: &quot;NSA's activities are focused and specifically deployed against &amp;#x2013; and only against &amp;#x2013; legitimate foreign intelligence targets in response to requirements that our leaders need for information necessary to protect our nation and its interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;XKeyscore is used as a part of NSA's lawful foreign signals intelligence collection system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Allegations of widespread, unchecked analyst access to NSA collection data are simply not true.&amp;#xA0;Access to XKeyscore, as well as all of NSA's analytic tools, is limited to only those personnel who require access for their assigned tasks &amp;#x2026; In addition, there are multiple technical, manual and supervisory checks and balances within the system to prevent deliberate misuse from occurring.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Every search by an NSA analyst is fully auditable, to ensure that they are proper and within the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;These types of programs allow us to collect the information that enables us to perform our missions successfully &amp;#x2013; to defend the nation and to protect US and allied troops abroad.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;section&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Give it a try.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a recent browser, the credit card input above will be progressively enhanced by Skeuocard. To begin, simply enter your card number (don't worry, it's not sent outside your browser). If that's too fishy for you (and I don't blame you), you can also try these valid credit card numbers to get the feel of it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Visa: 4111111111111111
American Express: 371111111111114
MasterCard: 5111111111111118
Discover: 6011111111111117
Diners Club: 30951111111116

4111 1111 1111 1111
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The numbers above will work with any expiration date (as long as it's in the future), any name, and any CVC code (the three or four digit verification code), since those are all validated on the server side upon authorization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How It Works&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you begin entering your card number, Skeuocard attempts to match it to an accepted card type. Once it is able to do so, it modifies the layout of the card to match the card product (Visa, MasterCard, etc) and makes any tweaks specific to the issuer -- for example, the special layout of the Chase Sapphire card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you enter your information, Skeuocard modifies the underlying form values from your original, non-enhanced form. It also validates each field to find simple user mistakes and missing fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the card product has fields on both sides of the card (for example, placing the CVC code on the back) the user will be prompted to flip the card to fill in the remaining fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Get It!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/kenkeiter/skeuocard/&quot;&gt;Skeuocard's GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; for documentation and source. Skeuocard is a work in progress, and I'll be doing my best to add new credit card layouts as quickly as people contribute them.&lt;/p&gt;

Kathy Sierra: Your app makes me fat

<description>
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;sqs-block-content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;An experiment
asked one group of dogs to sit, just sit, nothing else, for a few minutes before being
released to play with their favorite treat &amp;#x201C;puzzle&amp;#x201D; toy (the ones where the dog has
to work at getting the treats out of it). The other group of dogs were allowed to
just hang out in their crates before getting the treat puzzle.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know where this goes: the dogs that had to sit &amp;#x2014; exercising self-control &amp;#x2014; &lt;em&gt;gave up on the puzzle much earlier&lt;/em&gt; than the dogs that were
just hanging out in their crate.The dogs that were NOT burning cognitive
resources being obedient had more determination and mental/emotional energy for solving the puzzle. Think about that next&amp;#xA0;time you ask Sparky to be patient. &lt;em&gt;His cognitive
resources are easily-depleted too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now think about what we're doing to our &lt;em&gt;users&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your UX asks the user to make&amp;#xA0;&lt;em&gt;choices&lt;/em&gt;, for example, even if those choices are both clear and useful, the act of &lt;em&gt;deciding&lt;/em&gt; is a cognitive drain. And not just &lt;em&gt;while&lt;/em&gt; they're deciding... even &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; we choose, an unconscious cognitive background thread is slowly consuming/leaking resources, &quot;Was &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; the right choice?&quot;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your app is confusing and your tech support / FAQ isn't helpful, you&amp;#x2019;re drawing down my scarce, precious, cognitive resources. If your app behaves counter-intuitively &amp;#x2013; even just &lt;em&gt;once&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#x2013; I'll leak cog resources &lt;em&gt;every time I use it, forever,&amp;#xA0;&lt;/em&gt;wondering, &quot;wait, did that do what I expected?&quot;. Or let's say your app &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; super easy to use, but designed and tuned for persuasive brain hacks (&quot;nudges&quot;, gamification, behavioral tricks, etc.) to keep me &quot;engaged&quot; for &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; benefit, not mine (lookin' at you, Zynga)... you've still drained my cognitive resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when I
back away from the screen and walk to the kitchen...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your app makes me fat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If our work drains a user&amp;#x2019;s cognitive resources, what does he lose? What&amp;#xA0;&lt;em&gt;else&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#xA0;could he have done with those scarce, precious, easily-depleted resources? Maybe he&amp;#x2019;s trying to stick with that diet. Or practice guitar.&amp;#xA0;&lt;em&gt;Or play with his kids.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;That one new feature you added? That sparkly, Techcrunchable,&amp;#xA0;&lt;em&gt;awesome&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#xA0;feature? What did it&amp;#xA0;&lt;em&gt;cost&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#xA0;your user? If the result of your work consumes someone&amp;#x2019;s cognitive resources,&lt;em&gt;&amp;#xA0;they can&amp;#x2019;t use those resources for other things that truly, deeply matter.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/em&gt;This is NOT about consuming their time and attention&amp;#xA0;&lt;em&gt;while&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#xA0;they're using your app. This is about draining their ability for logical thinking, problem-solving, and willpower&amp;#xA0;&lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#xA0;the clicking/swiping/gesturing is done.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course it's not&lt;em&gt;&amp;#xA0;implicitly&amp;#xA0;&lt;/em&gt;bad if our work burns a user's cog resources.Your app might be&amp;#xA0;the one place your user&amp;#xA0;&lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#xA0;to spend those resources. But knowing that interacting with our product comes at a precious cost, maybe we&amp;#x2019;ll make different choices.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe&amp;#xA0;we&amp;#x2019;ll think more about what our users&amp;#xA0;&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#xA0;care about. Maybe we&amp;#x2019;ll ask ourselves at each design meeting, &amp;#x201C;is this a &lt;em&gt;Fruit&lt;/em&gt;-choosing feature or a &lt;em&gt;Cake&lt;/em&gt;-choosing feature?&amp;#x201D; and we&amp;#x2019;ll try to limit &lt;em&gt;Cake&lt;/em&gt;-choosing features&amp;#x2014;the ones that&amp;#xA0;&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#xA0;drain them &amp;#x2014; to that which supports &lt;em&gt;the thing they're using our app for in the first place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Yes, cognitive resources can be partly replenished throughout the day by getting glucose to the brain, but be careful with that. A high-protein snack combined with small infrequent sips on a sports drink can help, a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even if we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; justify consuming our user's cognitive resources while they're &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; our product, what about our &lt;em&gt;marketing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;?&lt;/em&gt; Can we honestly believe that our &quot;content marketing&quot; is a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; use of their resources? &quot;Yes, because it adds value.&quot; we tell ourselves. But what does that even mean? Can we honestly say that &quot;engaging with our brand&quot; is a healthy, ethical use of their scarce, precious, limited cognitive resources? &quot;Yes, because &lt;em&gt;our content is&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;useful&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that's all awesome and fabulous and social and 3.0ish except for one, small, inconvenient fact: &lt;strong&gt;zero sum&lt;/strong&gt;. What you consume &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;, you take from &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt;. Not just their &lt;em&gt;attention&lt;/em&gt;, not just their &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt;, but their &lt;em&gt;ability to be the person they are when they are at their best&lt;/em&gt;. When they have ample cognitive resources. When they can think, solve-problems, and exercise self-control. When they can create, make connections, and stay focused.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is that &quot;content&quot; worth it?&amp;#xA0; Maybe. But instead of &quot;&lt;em&gt;Is&lt;/em&gt; this useful?&quot; perhaps we should raise the bar and ask &quot;&lt;em&gt;Will&lt;/em&gt; they use it?&quot; (and so, yeah, I'm more than a little self-conscious about typing that as I consume &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; cognitive resources. But I didn't start Serious Pony to save &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; cognitive resources; I want to help save the cognitive resources of your &lt;em&gt;users&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I'm not &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; &quot;content marketing&quot;. On the contrary, it's nearly the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; form of cog-resource-draining marketing that &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be &quot;worth it&quot;. It's the one form of marketing that can help people become better at something they care about. It's one form of marketing with the potential to deliver the user-&lt;em&gt;learning&lt;/em&gt; so few companies care about. Content marketing can (and should) be &quot;the missing manual.&quot; It can (and should be) the inspiration for our users to learn, get better (at the thing &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; care about), and connect with other &lt;em&gt;users&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if it's &quot;content&quot; designed solely to suck people in (&quot;7 ways to be OMG awesome!!&quot;) &amp;#xA0;for the chance to &quot;convert&quot;, we're&amp;#xA0;&lt;em&gt;hurting&lt;/em&gt; people. If we're pumping out &quot;content&quot; because &lt;em&gt;frequency,&amp;#xA0;&lt;/em&gt;we're&amp;#xA0;&lt;em&gt;hurting&lt;/em&gt; people. I'm hurting some of you now. That's on me. It's why I try to use graphics to make the key point, so you don't have to &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; the post (also because I'm really rambly-aroundy, I know, workin' on it.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My father died unexpectedly last week, and as happens when one close to us dies, I had the &quot;on their deathbed, nobody thinks...&quot; moment. Over the past 20 years of my work, I've created interactive&amp;#xA0;marketing games, gamified sites (before it was called that), and dozens of other projects carefully, artfully, &lt;em&gt;scientifically&lt;/em&gt; designed to slurp (&lt;em&gt;gulp&lt;/em&gt;) cognitive resources for... &lt;i&gt;very little that was &quot;worth it&quot;.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#xA0; Did people willingly choose to engage with them? Of course. And by &quot;of course&quot; I mean, &lt;em&gt;not really, no&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#xA0;Not according to psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral economics research of the past 50 years. They were nudged/seduced/&lt;em&gt;tricked&lt;/em&gt;. And I was pretty good at it. I am so very, very sorry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My goal for Serious Pony is to help all of us take better care of our users. Not just &lt;em&gt;while&lt;/em&gt; they are interacting with our app, site, product, but &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt;. Not just &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; they are our users, but because they are &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Because on their deathbed, our users &lt;em&gt;won't&lt;/em&gt; be thinking,&lt;em&gt;&quot;If only I'd spent more time engaging with brands.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Help them conserve and manage their scarce, precious, easily-depleted cognitive resources for what really matters. To &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt;. And don't forget to take care of your &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt;. Think of the kids. Think of &lt;em&gt;Sparky&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

We have an employee whose last name is Null. He kills our employee lookup (2012)
</title>
<link>
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4456438/how-can-i-pass-the-string-null-through-wsdl-soap-from-as3-to-coldfusion-web?rq=1
</link>
<description>
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-text&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;@doc_180 had the right concept, except he is focused on numbers, whereas the original poster had issues with strings.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution is to change the &lt;code&gt;mx.rpc.xml.XMLEncoder&lt;/code&gt; file. This is line 121 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    if (content != null)
        result += content;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[I looked at Flex 4.5.1 SDK; line numbers may differ in other versions]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, the validation fails because 'content is null' and therefore your argument is not added to the outgoing SOAP Packet; thus causing the missing parameter error.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to extend this class to remove the validation.  Then there is a big snowball up the chain, modifying SOAPEncoder to use your modified XMLEncoder, and then modifying Operation to use your modified SOAPEncoder, and then moidfying WebService to use your alternate Operation class.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a few hours on it, but need to move on.  It'll probably take a day or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may be able to just fix the XMLEncoder line and do some monkey patching to use your own class.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll also add that if you switch to using RemoteObject/AMF with ColdFusion, the null is passed without problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

Creator of xkcd Reveals Secret Backstory of His Epic 3,990-Panel Comic
</title>
<link>

</link>
<description>
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;entry&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;660&quot; height=&quot;495&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/M5l8BhyGE68&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xkcd.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;xkcd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; creator Randall Munroe&amp;#xA0;first posted a new installment of his webcomic titled &amp;#x201C;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xkcd.com/1190/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Time&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#x201D; on March 25, it looked deceptively simple: a picture of two black and white stick figures, a man and a woman, sitting wordlessly on the ground. There was no story, no punchline, no words. 30 minutes later, &lt;a href=&quot;http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the image changed&lt;/a&gt;;&amp;#xA0;the figures shifted slightly. And they&amp;#xA0;continued to change every half-hour for the next week&amp;#x2013;and every hour for months after that&amp;#x2013;slowly coalescing into a story&amp;#xA0;as the two characters discovered disturbing changes in the landscape around them, and set out on an epic, time-lapsed journey to discover the truth about what was happening to their world.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers set out on a similar journey, although their path led not to the wild unknown, but rather back to the same URL where the mystery continued to unfold hour by hour. Who were these characters? Where were they? What did the story mean? Munroe offered no direct answers, instead seeding the panels with esoteric clues from botany, astronomy and geology. Soon, &amp;#x201C;Time&amp;#x201D; had developed a fanatical following that pored over every update pixel by pixel and gathered online to trade &lt;a href=&quot;http://xkcd-time.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_end_of_comic_theories&quot;&gt;theories&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://xkcd-time.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_theories_on_the_location_of_the_comic&quot;&gt;decipher clues&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=&quot;http://xkcd-time.wikia.com/wiki/Songs_written_in_the_forum&quot;&gt;write songs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obsessive devotees of the comic-within-a-comic&amp;#xA0;created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.xkcd.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;amp;t=101043&amp;amp;start=999999999&quot;&gt;discussion thread that exceeded 1,300 pages&lt;/a&gt;, a &amp;#x201C;Time&amp;#x201D;-specific &lt;a href=&quot;http://xkcd-time.wikia.com/wiki/XKCD_Time_Wiki&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;, and even made a &lt;a href=&quot;http://xkcd-time.wikia.com/wiki/Glossary&quot;&gt;glossary&lt;/a&gt; of the lexicon they invented to describe the world of &amp;#x201C;Time&amp;#x201D; and their experiences with it. While they refer to Munroe simply as &amp;#x201C;OTA&amp;#x201D; (the One True Author), a &amp;#x201C;newpic&amp;#x201D; (plural: &amp;#x201C;newpix&amp;#x201D;) is defined as the unit of time that elapses between updates, also known as &amp;#x201C;outsider minutes.&amp;#x201D;&amp;#xA0;True to its name, &amp;#x201C;Time&amp;#x201D;&amp;#x2013;where a single step could last an hour, and a night could span multiple real-life days&amp;#x2013;took on its own internal sense of chronological speed: glacially slow for animation, but imbued with a continual sense of motion that felt utterly unique for a comic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After more than four months of hourly updates, the journey finally came to an end last week, and the final product is 3,099 panels long&amp;#x2013;so long that the Youtube video compiling them (above) runs more than 40 minutes from start to finish. Even better, Munroe is finally talking about the elaborate backstory behind the minimalistic and seemingly ancient world of &amp;#x201C;Time,&amp;#x201D; which he reveals was set not in the past, but 11,000 years in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_178401&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignnone&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/underwire/2013/08/27bee12d53da588ffc55e48e2650c73ff242a369049d0c2eee408b76016f743a.png&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-178401 &quot; title=&quot;27bee12d53da588ffc55e48e2650c73ff242a369049d0c2eee408b76016f743a&quot; src=&quot;http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/underwire/2013/08/27bee12d53da588ffc55e48e2650c73ff242a369049d0c2eee408b76016f743a.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;660&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;Image: Panel 1,702 of &amp;#x201C;Time&amp;#x201D; by Randall Munroe&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;In my comic, our civilization is long gone. Every civilization with written records has existed for less than 5,000 years; it seems optimistic to hope that the current one will last for 10,000 more,&amp;#x201D; Munroe told WIRED. &amp;#x201C;And as astronomer Fred Hoyle has pointed out, since we&amp;#x2019;ve stripped away the easily-accessed fossil fuels, whatever civilization comes along next won&amp;#x2019;t be able to jump-start an industrial revolution the way we did.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the comic takes place many millennia in the future, its setting is modeled on a geological event that took place more than 5 million years ago, when tectonic activity sealed off the Mediterranean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean, causing the sea to evaporate and&amp;#xA0;leave a basin of dry land two miles below sea level. In Munroe&amp;#x2019;s comic, the same geologic shifts have reoccured in the distant future, and that&amp;#x2019;s where we find the characters when the comic opens: in the bottom of the desiccated Mediterranean Sea, building castles out of sand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comic also teeters on the cusp of another ancient (but potentially futuristic) occurrence: the moment when the ocean flooded back into the basin and refilled the Mediterranean Sea, a catastrophic event known as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanclean_flood&quot;&gt;Zanclean flood&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#xA0;Munroe described the deluge as &amp;#x201C;100,000 times the size of Niagara Falls. It&amp;#x2019;s only hinted at in the comic, but for geology geeks out there, the trigger was probably an expanded El Arraiche &amp;#x2018;mud volcano&amp;#x2019; outflow. Humans most likely helped it along&amp;#x2013;a Gibraltar Dam is a project that would appeal to engineers anywhere.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geographically, the comic takes place in the part of the basin between Africa and Europe, so Munroe researched and illustrated very specific plants and wildlife to offer readers hints about the location. &amp;#x201C;I got suggestions from botanists and herpetologists, and I had a file with details on every species the characters encountered or talked about, like dwarf palms, juniper trees, horned vipers, and sand boas.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_178411&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption alignleft&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/underwire/2013/08/33178d176c0e5181b70b89a11000bd148913f1a28cc907cdc10b8d771c5bb8c1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-178411&quot; title=&quot;33178d176c0e5181b70b89a11000bd148913f1a28cc907cdc10b8d771c5bb8c1&quot; src=&quot;http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/underwire/2013/08/33178d176c0e5181b70b89a11000bd148913f1a28cc907cdc10b8d771c5bb8c1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;660&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Panel 2,400 of &amp;#x201C;Time&amp;#x201D; by Randall Munroe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More clues lay not only within the world, but above it. Astronomically-savvy readers finally got a chance to nail down the time period of the comic during a striking sequence later in the series where the night sky slowly rotated over the characters, revealing a distinctly different configuration of stars than our present sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;The Earth&amp;#x2019;s axis wobbles over the millennia, and some individual stars move visibly, so I used a few different pieces of astronomy software&amp;#x2013;with a lot of hand correction and tweaking&amp;#x2013;to render the future night sky,&amp;#x201D; said Munroe. He also consulted with astronomer and science blogger &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/authors.phil_plait.html&quot;&gt;Phil Plait&lt;/a&gt; and learned that while most visible stars would still be around 11,000 years in the future, the red supergiant star Antares could go supernova and vanish from the starfield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;When the Sun sets in the night sequence, one of the first things you see is the gap where Antares should be, which was the first clue that this is taking place in the far future,&amp;#x201D; said Munroe. &amp;#x201C;Later in the night&amp;#x2013;which lasted for several days of real time&amp;#x2013;more astronomical details let readers pin down the date more precisely.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even now, some mysteries remain. With the help of a linguist, Munroe invented a language and orthography (dubbed&amp;#xA0;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xkcd-time.wikia.com/wiki/Beanish&quot;&gt;&amp;#x201C;Beanish&amp;#x201D;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#xA0;by readers)&amp;#xA0;for one of the foreign cultures his characters encounter, which he wanted to be &amp;#x201C;as different from [English] as our language is from Linear A or Linear B,&amp;#x201D; the still-undeciphered writing systems of ancient Crete. His abstruse approach worked; despite the efforts of &amp;#x201C;Time&amp;#x201D; superfans, no one has been able to decode the language, which Munroe finds fitting since &amp;#x201C;we haven&amp;#x2019;t cracked Linear A, either!&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Munroe says that artifacts of the sprawling world he created in the space of a single panel might someday make their way into his other work: &amp;#x201C;Maybe I&amp;#x2019;ll find a way to sneak a bit more of the language into another&amp;#xA0;&lt;em&gt;xkcd&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#xA0;comic.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the story is over, new readers can still go back and&amp;#xA0;&lt;a href=&quot;http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/&quot;&gt;navigate the comic frame by frame&lt;/a&gt; or view it as a video, although the experience of deciphering its mysteries in real-time alongside a community of equally devoted fans seems impossible to duplicate. And that&amp;#x2019;s what makes &amp;#x201C;Time&amp;#x201D; so fascinating: not just the meticulous, interdisciplinary details of its backstory, or the community that formed around it, but the way the comic felt embedded with the experience of time itself, and perhaps equally ephemeral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correction 11:05 AM EST 8/2/2013: The number of panels in the completed comic is 3,099, not 3,990.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;Post&quot;&gt;
              
              
                
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.tumblr.com/acb1cc79e7b20a8881b03f564fcc3834/tumblr_inline_mqrgfcCiI01qz4rgp.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Photoshop file format is over 23 years old, yet it remains one of the most opaque file formats out there. PSDs are very widely used, yet Adobe has never produced an easy way for developers to work with the format. Indeed, some developers have &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/xee/source/browse/XeePhotoshopLoader.m#102&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gone mad&lt;/a&gt; trying to parse PSDs. We know the feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some time, we&amp;#x2019;ve been meticulously building a tool to open the Photoshop format. It&amp;#x2019;s a Ruby library for reading and writing PSDs, and it&amp;#x2019;s called &lt;a href=&quot;http://cosmos.layervault.com/psdrb.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PSD.rb&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#x2019;s what is behind some of the great improvements to LayerVault recently, namely the &lt;a href=&quot;http://layervault.tumblr.com/post/55616251514/new-tool-click-to-copy-text&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Type Tool&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://layervault.tumblr.com/post/56357461327/introducing-style-guides&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Style Guides&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we&amp;#x2019;re not the only ones that can benefit from this code, so today we&amp;#x2019;re open-sourcing what we&amp;#x2019;ve learned under the MIT license. What you&amp;#x2019;ll find is a robust, modern, and fast way to programmatically access Photoshop documents. It&amp;#x2019;s a real pleasure to work with. This represents the most mature and up-to-date way to access Photoshop documents, outside of using Photoshop itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#x2019;s still plenty more the library can do, but we think this is a great start. We encourage everyone to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layervault/psd.rb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fork the code on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and open a Pull Request.&lt;/p&gt;
              
              
              

              

              

              

              

                

              
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave a talk at the DBX conference called &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/71278954&quot;&gt;The Future of Programming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.  Below are links and quotes from some primary sources I used, as well as links to wikipedia and elsewhere where you can learn more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Much of the overall message and style of the talk was inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay&quot;&gt;Alan Kay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more talks with a similar message, I highly recommend:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reactions to SOAP and Fortran&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;indented&quot; href=&quot;http://worrydream.com/refs/Hamming-TheArtOfDoingScienceAndEngineering.pdf&quot;&gt;Richard Hamming -- The Art of Doing Science and Engineering, p25&lt;/a&gt; (pdf book)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;In the beginning we programmed in absolute binary... Finally, a Symbolic Assembly Program was devised -- after more years than you are apt to believe during which most programmers continued their heroic absolute binary programming. At the time [the assembler] first appeared I would guess about 1% of the older programmers were interested in it -- using [assembly] was &quot;sissy stuff&quot;, and a real programmer would not stoop to wasting machine capacity to do the assembly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Yes! Programmers wanted no part of it, though when pressed they had to admit their old methods used more machine time in locating and fixing up errors than the [assembler] ever used. One of the main complaints was when using a symbolic system you do not know where anything was in storage -- though in the early days we supplied a mapping of symbolic to actual storage, and believe it or not they later lovingly pored over such sheets rather than realize they did not need to know that information if they stuck to operating within the system -- no! When correcting errors they preferred to do it in absolute binary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;FORTRAN was proposed by Backus and friends, and again was opposed by almost all programmers. First, it was said it could not be done. Second, if it could be done, it would be too wasteful of machine time and capacity. Third, even if it did work, no respectable programmer would use it -- it was only for sissies!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;John von Neumann's reaction to assembly language and Fortran&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;indented&quot; href=&quot;http://www.columbia.edu/cu/computinghistory/index.html&quot;&gt;John A.N. Lee, Virginia Polytechnical Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;John von Neumann, when he first heard about FORTRAN in 1954, was unimpressed and asked &quot;why would you want more than machine language?&quot; One of von Neumann's students at Princeton recalled that graduate students were being used to hand assemble programs into binary for their early machine. This student took time out to build an assembler, but when von Neumann found out about it he was very angry, saying that it was a waste of a valuable scientific computing instrument to use it to do clerical work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Surely there must be a less primitive way of making big changes in the store than by pushing vast numbers of words back and forth through the von Neumann bottleneck. Not only is this tube a literal bottleneck for the data traffic of a problem, but, more importantly, it is an intellectual bottleneck that has kept us tied to word-at-a-time thinking instead of encouraging us to think in terms of the larger conceptual units of the task at hand. Thus programming is basically planning and detailing the enormous traffic of words through the von Neumann bottleneck, and much of that traffic concerns not significant data itself, but where to find it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;We don't know what programming is.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;indented&quot; href=&quot;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/We-Really-Dont-Know-How-To-Compute&quot;&gt;Gerry Sussman -- We Really Don't Know How To Compute!&lt;/a&gt; (video)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;[intro] I think we're in real trouble.  I think we haven't the foggiest idea how to compute real well...  I think that most of the things we've been talking about, even here [at this conference], are obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;[40:30] I'm only pushing this idea, not because I think it's the right answer. I'm trying to twist us, so we say, &quot;This is a different way to think.&quot; We have to think fifty-two different ways to fix this problem. I don't know how to make a machine that builds a person out of a cell. But I think the problem is that we've been stuck for too long diddling with our details. We've been sitting here worrying about our type system, when we should be worrying about how to get flexible machines and flexible programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;[1:01:30] We have to throw away our current ways of thinking if we ever expect to solve these problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;The most dangerous thought you can have a creative person is to think you know what you're doing.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;indented&quot; href=&quot;http://worrydream.com/refs/Hamming-TheArtOfDoingScienceAndEngineering.pdf&quot;&gt;Richard Hamming -- The Art of Doing Science and Engineering, p5&lt;/a&gt; (pdf book)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;In science if you know what you are doing you should not be doing it.
&lt;br&gt;In engineering if you do not know what you are doing you should not be doing it.
&lt;br&gt;Of course, you seldom, if ever, see either pure state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;indented&quot; href=&quot;http://longnow.org/essays/richard-feynman-connection-machine&quot;&gt;Danny Hillis -- Richard Feynman and The Connection Machine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;In retrospect I realize that in almost everything that we [Hillis and Feynman] worked on together, we were both amateurs. In digital physics, neural networks, even parallel computing, we never really knew what we were doing. But the things that we studied were so new that no one else knew exactly what they were doing either. It was amateurs who made the progress.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;&quot;Why did all these ideas happen during this particular time period?&quot;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may be a number of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story I told in the talk -- &quot;they didn't know what they were doing, so they tried everything&quot; -- was essentially that programming at the time was in the &quot;pre-&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm&quot;&gt;paradigm&lt;/a&gt; phase&quot;, as defined by Thomas Kuhn in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions&quot;&gt;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&lt;/a&gt;.  This is the period of time before researchers reach consensus on what problems they're actually trying to solve.  The establishment of distinct &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm&quot;&gt;programming paradigms&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., functional, logic, etc.) led into Kuhn's &quot;normal science&quot; phase (or as Sussman put it, &quot;diddling with details&quot;) where the foundations of the subject tend to be taken for granted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there's another story, which has to do with funding models.  Much fundamental research at the time, including Engelbart's NLS and the Internet, was funded by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA&quot;&gt;ARPA&lt;/a&gt;, an agency of the US Defense Department which had been given significant resources due to the cold war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;indented&quot; href=&quot;http://worrydream.com/refs/FoundingOfTheAILab.pdf&quot;&gt;Stefanie Chiou, et al -- The Founding of the MIT AI Lab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;ARPA ushered in an era of abundant funding for university projects, offering far more in terms of funding than any other research funds at the time. Where institutions such as the National Science Foundation and the Three Services Program provided funding to research programs at the level of tens of thousands of dollars, ARPA was willing to throw millions into the creation and support of promising research efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of what made ARPA funding so successful was that its directors (such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JCR_Licklider&quot;&gt;J.C.R. Licklider&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Taylor_(computer_scientist)&quot;&gt;Bob Taylor&lt;/a&gt;) were free to aggressively seek out and fund promising individuals with &quot;no strings attached&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;indented&quot; href=&quot;http://worrydream.com/refs/FoundingOfTheAILab.pdf&quot;&gt;Ibid.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The funding model used within ARPA at the time was that of giving large chunks of money to individual laboratories to be divided up at the discretion of the laboratory director.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This situation changed around 1973, when ARPA became DARPA.  (The D is for Defense.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;indented&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA&quot;&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The Mansfield Amendment of 1973 expressly limited appropriations for defense
research (through ARPA/DARPA) to projects with &lt;i&gt;direct military application&lt;/i&gt;.
Some contend that the amendment devastated American science, since
ARPA/DARPA was a major funding source for basic science projects of the
time; the National Science Foundation never made up the difference as
expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The resulting &quot;brain drain&quot; is also credited with boosting the development
of the fledgling personal computer industry. Many young computer scientists
fled from the universities to startups and private research labs like Xerox
PARC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way of interpreting this is that the Mansfield Amendment killed research, but &quot;induced labor&quot; on an industry.  The industrial mindset -- short-term, results-driven, immediately-applicable -- is generally hostile to long-term, exploratory, foundational research.  (The canonical counterexamples, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs&quot;&gt;Bell Labs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)&quot;&gt;Xerox PARC&lt;/a&gt;, were anomalies for various reasons.  See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/0143122797&quot;&gt;The Idea Factory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/0887309895&quot;&gt;Dealers of Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, respectively.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Foundation&quot;&gt;National Science Foundation&lt;/a&gt; continued to exist as a basic-science funding agency.  But unlike ARPA, the NSF funds &lt;i&gt;projects, not people&lt;/i&gt;, and project proposals must be accepted by a peer review board.  Any sufficiently-revolutionary project, especially at the early stages, will sound too crazy for a board to accept.  Worse, requiring a detailed project proposal means that the NSF simply can't fund truly exploratory research, where the goal is not to solve a problem, but to discover and understand the problem in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A clarification about &quot;not knowing what you're doing&quot;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;xoutro&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;The most dangerous thought you can have a creative person is to think you know what you're doing.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's possible to misinterpret what I'm saying here.  When I talk about not knowing what you're doing, I'm arguing against &quot;expertise&quot;, a feeling of mastery that traps you in a particular way of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I want to be clear -- &lt;i&gt;I am not advocating ignorance.&lt;/i&gt;  Instead, I'm suggesting a kind of informed skepticism, a kind of humility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ignorance is remaining willfully unaware of the existing base of knowledge in a field, proudly jumping in and stumbling around.  This approach is fashionable in certain hacker/maker circles today, and it's poison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is essential.  Past ideas are essential.  Knowledge and ideas that have coalesced into &lt;i&gt;theory&lt;/i&gt; is one of the most beautiful creations of the human race.  Without Maxwell's equations, you can spend a lifetime fiddling with radio waves and never invent radar.  Without dynamic programming, you can code for days and &lt;a href=&quot;http://pindancing.blogspot.com/2009/09/sudoku-in-coders-at-work.html&quot;&gt;not even build a sudoku solver&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's good to learn how to do something.  It's better to learn many ways of doing something.  But it's best to learn all these ways as &lt;i&gt;suggestions or hints&lt;/i&gt;.  Not &lt;i&gt;truth&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn tools, and use tools, but don't &lt;i&gt;accept&lt;/i&gt; tools.  Always distrust them; always be alert for alternative ways of thinking.  This is what I mean by avoiding the conviction that you &quot;know what you're doing&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This point is perhaps best made by David Hestenes. Here, he's writing about mathematical tools for physics, but his observation applies identically to any sort of tool or way of thinking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;indented&quot; href=&quot;http://worrydream.com/refs/Hestenes-ReformingTheMathematicalLanguageOfPhysics.pdf&quot;&gt;David Hestenes -- Reforming the Mathematical Language of Physics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;Mathematics is taken for granted in the physics curriculum -- a body of immutable truths to be assimilated and applied. The profound influence of mathematics on our conceptions of the physical world is never analyzed. The possibility that mathematical tools used today were &lt;b&gt;invented to solve problems in the past and might not be well suited for current problems&lt;/b&gt; is never considered...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;One does not have to go very deeply into the history of physics to discover the profound influence of mathematical invention. Two famous examples will suffice to make the point: The invention of analytic geometry and calculus was essential to Newton&amp;#x2019;s creation of classical mechanics. The invention of tensor analysis was essential to Einstein&amp;#x2019;s creation of the General Theory of Relativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;The point I wish to make by citing these two examples is that without essential mathematical concepts the two theories would have been literally inconceivable. &lt;b&gt;The mathematical modeling tools we employ at once extend and limit our ability to conceive the world.&lt;/b&gt; Limitations of mathematics are evident in the fact that the analytic geometry that provides the foundation for classical mechanics is insufficient for General Relativity. This should alert one to the possibility of other conceptual limits in the mathematics used by physicists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, here's some advice Alan Kay gave me (as I was going through a small personal crisis as a result of reading Jerome Bruner's &quot;Toward a Theory of Instruction&quot;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I think the trick with knowledge is to &quot;acquire it, and forget all except the perfume&quot; -- because it is noisy and sometimes drowns out one's own &quot;brain voices&quot;. The perfume part is important because it will help find the knowledge again to help get to the destinations the inner urges pick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<description>
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-field body notes-source&quot;&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;06f4&quot;&gt;It was a confluence of magnificent proportions that led to six agents from the joint terrorism task force to knock on my door Wednesday morning. Little did we know our seemingly innocent, if curious to a fault, Googling of certain things were creating a perfect storm of terrorism profiling. Because somewhere out there, someone was watching. Someone whose job it is to piece together the things people do on the internet raised the red flag when they saw our search history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;d187&quot;&gt;Most of it was innocent enough. I had researched pressure cookers. My husband was looking for a backpack. And maybe in another time those two things together would have seemed innocuous, but we are in &amp;#x201C;these times&amp;#x201D; now. And in these times, when things like the Boston bombing happen, you spend a lot of time on the internet reading about it and, if you are my exceedingly curious, news junkie 20 year old son, you click a lot of links when you read the myriad of stories. You might just read a CNN piece about how bomb making instructions are readily available on the internet and you will in all probability, if you are that kid, click the link provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;1812&quot;&gt;Which might not raise any red flags. Because who wasn&amp;#x2019;t reading those stories? Who wasn&amp;#x2019;t clicking those links? But my son&amp;#x2019;s reading habits combined with my search for a pressure cooker and my husband&amp;#x2019;s search for a backpack set off an alarm of sorts at the joint terrorism task force headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;ec84&quot;&gt;That&amp;#x2019;s how I imagine it played out, anyhow. Lots of bells and whistles and a crowd of task force workers huddled around a computer screen looking at our Google history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;096c&quot;&gt;This was weeks ago. I don&amp;#x2019;t know what took them so long to get here. Maybe they were waiting for some other devious Google search to show up but &amp;#x201C;what the hell do I do with quinoa&amp;#x201D; and &amp;#x201C;Is A-Rod suspended yet&amp;#x201D; didn&amp;#x2019;t fit into the equation so they just moved in based on those older searches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;cfe4&quot;&gt;I was at work when it happened. My husband called me as soon as it was over, almost laughing about it but I wasn&amp;#x2019;t joining in the laughter. His call left me shaken and anxious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;b031&quot;&gt;What happened was this: At about 9:00 am, my husband, who happened to be home yesterday, was sitting in the living room with our two dogs when he heard a couple of cars pull up outside. He looked out the window and saw three black SUVs in front of our house; two at the curb in front and one pulled up behind my husband&amp;#x2019;s Jeep in the driveway, as if to block him from leaving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;7936&quot;&gt;Six gentleman in casual clothes emerged from the vehicles and spread out as they walked toward the house, two toward the backyard on one side, two on the other side, two toward the front door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;ba29&quot;&gt;A million things went through my husband&amp;#x2019;s head. None of which were right. He walked outside and the men greeted him by flashing badges. He could see they all had guns holstered in their waistbands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;8b31&quot;&gt;&amp;#x201C;Are you [name redacted]?&amp;#x201D; one asked while glancing at a clipboard. He affirmed that was indeed him, and was asked if they could come in. Sure, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;7c6c&quot;&gt;They asked if they could search the house, though it turned out to be just a cursory search. They walked around the living room, studied the books on the shelf (nope, no bomb making books, no Anarchist Cookbook), looked at all our pictures, glanced into our bedroom, pet our dogs. They asked if they could go in my son&amp;#x2019;s bedroom but when my husband said my son was sleeping in there, they let it be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;b098&quot;&gt;Meanwhile, they were peppering my husband with questions. Where is he from? Where are his parents from? They asked about me, where was I, where do I work, where do my parents live.&lt;em&gt; Do you have any bombs&lt;/em&gt;, they asked. Do you own a pressure cooker? My husband said no, but we have a rice cooker. Can you make a bomb with that? My husband said no, my wife uses it to make quinoa. What the hell is quinoa, they asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;9ac7&quot;&gt;They searched the backyard. They walked around the garage, as much as one could walk around a garage strewn with yardworking equipment and various junk. They went back in the house and asked more questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;1e5e&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have you ever looked up how to make a pressure cooker bomb?&lt;/em&gt; My husband, ever the oppositional kind, asked them if they themselves weren&amp;#x2019;t curious as to how a pressure cooker bomb works, if they ever looked it up. Two of them admitted they did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;77c6&quot;&gt;By this point they had realized they were not dealing with terrorists. They asked my husband about his work, his visits to South Korea and China. The tone was conversational.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;7064&quot;&gt;They never asked to see the computers on which the searches were done. They never opened a drawer or a cabinet. They left two rooms unsearched. I guess we didn&amp;#x2019;t fit the exact profile they were looking for so they were just going through the motions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;87d3&quot;&gt;They mentioned that they do this about 100 times a week. And that 99 of those visits turn out to be nothing. I don&amp;#x2019;t know what happens on the other 1% of visits and I&amp;#x2019;m not sure I want to know what my neighbors are up to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;ff9b&quot;&gt;45 minutes later, they shook my husband&amp;#x2019;s hand and left. That&amp;#x2019;s when he called me and relayed the story. That&amp;#x2019;s when I felt a sense of creeping dread take over. What else had I looked up? What kind of searches did I do that alone seemed innocent enough but put together could make someone suspicious? Were they judging me because my house was a mess (Oh my god, the joint terrorism task force was in my house and there were dirty dishes in my sink!). Mostly I felt a great sense of anxiety. This is where we are at. Where you have no expectation of privacy. Where trying to learn how to cook some lentils could possibly land you on a watch list. Where you have to watch every little thing you do because someone else is watching every little thing you do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;0a06&quot;&gt;All I know is if I&amp;#x2019;m going to buy a pressure cooker in the near future, I&amp;#x2019;m not doing it online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p name=&quot;754d&quot;&gt;I&amp;#x2019;m scared. And not of the right things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has been issued papers which will allow him to enter Russian territory, according to his legal representative in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
                
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;&amp;#x201C;I have just handed over to him papers from the Russian
  Immigration Service. They are what he needs to leave the transit
  zone,&amp;#x201D;&lt;/i&gt; Anatoly Kucherena told Interfax.
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  Snowden, a former CIA employee and NSA contractor, came to
  international prominence after leaking several classified
  documents detailing massive electronic surveillance by the US
  government and foreign allies who collaborated with them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  Snowden was hiding out in a Hong Kong hotel when he first went
  public in May. Amidst mounting US pressure on both Beijing and
  local authorities in the former-British colony to hand the
  whistleblower over for prosecution, Snowden flew to Moscow on
  June 23.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  Moscow was initially intended as a temporary stopover on his
  journey, as Snowden was believed to be headed to Ecuador via
  Cuba. However, he ended up getting stranded at Moscow&amp;#x2019;s
  Sheremetyevo Airport after the US government revoked his
  passport. Snowden could neither leave Russia nor enter it,
  forcing him to remain in the airport&amp;#x2019;s transit zone.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  In July, Snowden applied for temporary asylum in Russia, a status
  that would allow him to live and work in the country for one
  year. Kucherena earlier said the fugitive whistleblower is
  considering securing permanent residency in Russia, where he will
  attempt to build a life.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Scientific Breakthrough Lets SnappyCam App Take 20 Full-Res Photos Per Second
</title>
<link>
http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/31/fastest-iphone-camera/
</link>
<description>
&lt;div class=&quot;body-copy&quot; score=&quot;13.75&quot;&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Your standard iPhone camera app is actually pretty slow, able to take just three to six photos per second at 8 megapixels each. But with &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.snappycam.com/&quot;&gt;SnappyCam 3.0&lt;/a&gt;, you can shoot 20 full-resolution photos per second thanks to a breakthrough in discrete cosine transform JPG science by its inventor. Twenty frames per second is fast enough to capture shot-by-shot animations or every gruesome detail of an extreme sports crash.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snappycam/id463688713?mt=8&amp;amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4&quot;&gt;SnappyCam costs $0.99&lt;/a&gt; and lets you hold down your finger to take a constant stream of photos. You can then pick your favorites from a burst you shot, or view them as a “living photo” slideshow you can scrub back and forth through, kind of like &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/11/everlapse/&quot;&gt;collaborative photo sharing app Everlapse&lt;/a&gt;. Check out a sample of these animations &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.snappycam.com/press-samples&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-large wp-image-854620&quot; alt=&quot;SnappyCam Features&quot; src=&quot;http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/snappycam-features.png?w=640&amp;amp;h=393&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Papandriopoulos has a PhD in electrical engineering and has been building SnappyCam for two years. He calls it the fastest smartphone camera app on Earth. He essentially reinvented the JPG image standard in order to learn how he could speed up the process of capturing, buffering, processing and compressing photos on the iPhone. His goal? To put the continuous shooting power of a big, professional Digital SLR camera in your pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SnappyCam version 2 was reasonably … snappy, but it had to sacrifice image quality. It could only take 20 photos per second at a 3-megapixel resolution. Then last week, Papandriopoulos had a Eureka moment. Through some complex mathematical algorithms and taking advantage of the iPhone 5′s dual-core processor, it can now take full 8-megapixel photos at 20 frames per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Papandriopoulos tells me the speed “is kind of unbelievable. That’s actually the limit of the hardware.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright size-medium wp-image-854622&quot; alt=&quot;03-Rollerblader-long-jump&quot; src=&quot;http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/03-rollerblader-long-jump.jpg?w=300&amp;amp;h=225&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;&gt;To put the speed in perspective, SnappyCam is about 4X faster than the normal iPhone 5 Camera app, and more than twice as quick as the Samsung Galaxy S4′s 7.5 shots per second. Papandriopoulos claims that other iOS camera apps built for speed like &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.i4fastcamera.com/&quot;&gt;FastCamera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.awesomize.com/&quot;&gt;Camera Awesome&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://campl.us/&quot;&gt;Camera+&lt;/a&gt; often degrade photos to 0.3-megapixel postage stamps when they try to get up to 30fps, and can only do around 4fps at full resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SnappyCam isn’t just for the latest iPhone owners. On the iPhone 4S it gets 12fps at an 8-megapixel resolution, or 15fps at a 5-megapixel resolution. That’s way faster than the Samsung Galaxy S3, which only handles 3.3fps at full resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this science boils down to letting you choose the best smile from a portrait, review your baseball swing, capture your dog jumping around, and a lot more. Next Papandriopoulos is working to let you export the interactive animations SnappyCam creates so you can share them on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way Instagram helps you see art in everyday life, or Vine allows you to capture a moment, &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snappycam/id463688713?mt=8&amp;amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4&quot;&gt;SnappyCam&lt;/a&gt; could let you see the world in slow motion.&lt;/p&gt;

Hard drive hack provides root access, even after reinstall
</title>
<link>
http://spritesmods.com/?art=hddhack
</link>
<description>
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Apart from this article, I also gave a talk at 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://ohm2013.org/&quot;&gt;OHM2013&lt;/a&gt; about this subject. As soon
as the video recordings made at that time are available, I'll link there.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://meuk.spritesserver.nl/foto/foto/hdhack/IMG_2286.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://meuk.spritesserver.nl/foto/foto/hdhack/tmb-IMG_2286.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hard disks: if you read this, it's pretty much certain you use one
or more of the things. They're pretty simple: they basically present
a bunch of 512-byte sectors, numbered by an increasing address, 
also known as the LBA or Logical Block Address. The
PC the HD is connected to can read or write data to and from these 
sectors. Usually, a file system is used that abstracts all those
sectors to files and folders.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you look at an HD from that naive standpoint, you would think
the hardware should be pretty simple: all you need is something that
connects to a SATA-port which can then position the read/write-head
and read or write data from or to the platters. But maybe more is 
involved: don't hard disks also handle bad block management and
SMART attributes, and don't they usually have some cache they must
somehow manage?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All that implies there's some intelligence in an hard disk, and
intelligence usually implies hackability. I'm always interested
in hackability, so I decided I wanted to look into how hard disks
work on the non-mechanical level. Research like this has been done
before for various bits of hardware: from PCI extension cards to
embedded controllers in laptops to even Apple keyboards. Usually
the research has been done in order to prove the hackability of these
devices can lead to compromised software, so I decided to take the same
approach: for this hack, I wanted to make a hard disk that could bypass
software security.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;prevnext&quot;&gt;&amp;#xA0;1&amp;#xA0;&lt;a href=&quot;http://spritesmods.com/?art=hddhack&amp;amp;page=2&quot;&gt;Next &amp;#xBB;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;rdb-page-break&quot; /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
To figure out if hard disks are hackable, I first had to get to know
them better. Luckily, like most of you, I had a whole stack of old 
and/or broken hard disks to look at:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://meuk.spritesserver.nl/foto/foto/hdhack/IMG_2270.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://meuk.spritesserver.nl/foto/foto/hdhack/tmb-IMG_2270.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ofcourse, we all know how the mechanical parts of a hard disk are
supposed to work, and I wasn't really interested in those parts. My
interest was in the little PCB that's on the back of most HDs and
where the SATA and power connectors were located. This is what such a
PCB looks like:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://meuk.spritesserver.nl/foto/foto/hdhack/IMG_2271.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://meuk.spritesserver.nl/foto/foto/hdhack/tmb-IMG_2271.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can see that there are about four chips on the PCB. This is what 
I found out about them:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://spritesmods.com/meukspritesserver/foto/foto/hdhack/tmb-ic_dram.png&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is a bit of DRAM. It's a jellybean part, with easy-to-find
datasheets. The capacity of these chips range from 8MB to 64MB, and
these sizes correspond to the cache size the hard disk is supposed
to have.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://spritesmods.com/meukspritesserver/foto/foto/hdhack/tmb-ic_motorctl.png&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is the spindle motor controller. It's not a standard part,
so datasheets are hard to find, but some of the controllers seem
to have brothers and sisters that are a bit easier to find. ST Smooth
controllers seem to be the most used ones; apart from driving the 
spindle motor, they also do power regulation and have some A/D channels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://spritesmods.com/meukspritesserver/foto/foto/hdhack/tmb-ic_flash.png&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is a bit of serial flash. It's also a jellybean part, with
sizes ranging from 64KB to 256KB. It seems to be used to store the
program the hard disk controller boots up from. Some hard disks don't
have this chip but have the flash internal to the HD controller chip
instead.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://spritesmods.com/meukspritesserver/foto/foto/hdhack/tmb-ic_shock.png&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
These little devices aren't chips, but piezo-electric shock sensors.
They can be used to move the heads somewhere safe when the HD 
experiences a mechanical shock, but more likely just set a bit somewhere
to indicate your warranty is void because you dropped your HD.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://spritesmods.com/meukspritesserver/foto/foto/hdhack/tmb-ic_hddctl.png&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And this is the bit where all the fun stuff happens: the hard disk
controller. They are made by Marvell, ST and some other LSI companies.
Some hard disk companies also make their own controllers: I've seen
both Samsung and Western Digital do this. With almost everything else 
being a jellybean part, this is the device I was interested in.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Unfortunately, these parts are somewhat underdocumented. Saying the
companies making the controllers aren't too kind on revealing 
information about them is an understatement: they don't even
mention the existence of the part numbers on their sites! Unfortunately,
the rest of the Internet isn't too helpful either: looking for datasheets
only reveal datasheet-sites not having the actual PDFs and obscure 
Chinese sellers claiming to have the ICs. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, no datasheets of the most important IC, that means we're stranded,
right?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;prevnext&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://spritesmods.com/?art=hddhack&amp;amp;page=1&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;laquo Prev&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#xA0;2&amp;#xA0;&lt;a href=&quot;http://spritesmods.com/?art=hddhack&amp;amp;page=3&quot;&gt;Next &amp;#xBB;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;rdb-page-break&quot; /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
Luckily, there are other ways to find out information about these ICs
than datasheets. One of my web searches actually resulted in something
useful.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
what I found was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://forum.hddguru.com/viewtopic.php?t=20324&amp;amp;start=&quot;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; from a guy called Dejan on the HDDGuru forums.
Dejan had managed to corrupt the internal flash of his hard disk
in some way and wanted to know if there's a way to either boot the 
controller from external flash, or a method to re-write the flash.
For five days, he doesn't get a reponse, but the guy is inventive: the
next thing he posts is the message that he has found the pinout of the
JTAG-port. That's a major find: the JTAG-port can be used to control
a controller like a puppet. You can stop it, restart it, modify memory,
set breakpoints etc with it. Dejan then figures out how to dump the
boot ROM of the controller, figures out there's a serial port on one
of the hard disk headers and manages to restore his flash ROM. He
then dumps a few more bits and pointers about the flash update process
before finally disappearing into the mists of the Internet again.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All this was pretty useful information: it told me at least the
Western Digital controllers seem to have an ARM-core that's accessible
over the JTAG-port. It also told me these hard disks usually have a 
serial port, which is usually unused but could be useful for debugging
my hack. With this, I should have enough information to start hacking.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, this is my setup:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://meuk.spritesserver.nl/foto/foto/hdhack/IMG_2294c.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://meuk.spritesserver.nl/foto/foto/hdhack/tmb-IMG_2294c.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The red thing is an FT2232H-board, a cheap board you can get for about
EUR30 which can do JTAG and serial, as well as SPI-communications. It's
connected to the JTAG-interface of the hard disk, as well as the header
where the hard disk has its serial port. The HD is directly connected
to the SATA-port on my computers mainboard, as well as to an external 
ATX power supply. I use OpenOCD as the software to drive the JTAG-port.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, the question is: would it actually work? Dejan did this with 
a 2.5&quot; 250G HD with an 88i6745-controller, and he detected an arm9-core.
I grabbed a 3.5&quot; 2TB HD with an 88i9146-controller instead, which had
a different form factor and is a bit newer. Luckily, OpenOCD has a way
to detect what's on the JTAG chain by itself. This is what it found:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://meuk.spritesserver.nl/foto/foto/hdhack/multicore.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://meuk.spritesserver.nl/foto/foto/hdhack/tmb-multicore.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This confused me for a bit... I expected a single tap, for the single ARM
core that's inthere... but instead, I found &lt;i&gt;three&lt;/i&gt; taps... does
that mean this chip has three ARM-cores?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After some research, I found out that yes, the chip indeed seems to have
three cores. There's two Feroceons, which are quite powerful arm9-like 
cores, and a Cortex-M3 core, which is a bit smaller, more 
microcontroller-ish core. Some more playing around (and later research)
indicating the controllers all had different functions:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feroceon 1 handles the physical reading and writing from/to the 
hard disk platters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feroceon 2 handles the SATA-interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feroceon 2 also handles the cache and LBA to CHS translation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Cortex-M3 handles... nothing? I could stop it and still have
all hard disk functions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Now, what core to start hacking at? My target was to try and compromise
the security of a system by using hard disk firmware mods. The easiest
and probably hardest-to-detect way to do this was to modify data on the
fly. That way, the data on the disk wouldn't need to be changed and the
firmware could just make itself invisible. To do this, I would need
to find a suitable core to that kind of interception: I needed to
have a core that would have access to the data when it's in-transit 
from the disk to the SATA-cable, and also could be rigged to modify
the data while it was in between those two points.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, how would that data get from the HD platters to the SATA interface?
Here's where I used a bit of intuition. My reasoning went something 
like this:&lt;br&gt;
If the processors would use a standard memory copy, with them running
at 150MHz, they would only be able to reach 150*23/2=2.4Gbps, and in
practice most likely much less. The hard disk is specced at 6Gbps, so
there's probably some hardware acceleration involved. The most likely
hardware acceleration would be to use DMA. That would mean the data
is copied directly from the head reading logic to memory, without
active involvment of the processor. The same goes for the SATA-port:
the processor would have to only indicate where the data is, and the
DMA logic would take care of reading the data directly from memory. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If this was the case, where would the memory that the DMA-engine would
be pointed at, be located? The cache of the hard disk would be a good
location: data read from the disk would need to be in cache anyway, so
it would make sense to copy it there immediately when reading from the 
disk. I figured out earlier that Feroceon 2 was responsible for the
cache handling; that'd make it a prime target for a hacking attempt.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, I deduced that the data was read and written through DMA, without
any CPU action involved. Now the question was: Even if the CPUs 
&lt;i&gt;won't&lt;/i&gt; touch the data in normal operation, &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; they
actually access it? To answer this question, I first used the 
JTAG-connection and a bit of disassembly to figure out the memory map
of the 2nd Feroceon:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://meuk.spritesserver.nl/foto/foto/hdhack/memmap.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://meuk.spritesserver.nl/foto/foto/hdhack/tmb-memmap.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As you can see, the memory map is a bit fragmented. There are small
bits of RAM sprinkled around, there's some IO and IRQ space, and a
bit of internal boot ROM. There also is a big, 64MB segment of what
I suspected was the DRAM-chip with the cache in it. Let's find out
if this is actually true. First, I mounted the disk on my machine and
wrote 'Hello world!' to a file on it. Now, could I find the string 
in the 64MB mem region?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://meuk.spritesserver.nl/foto/foto/hdhack/cachedemo.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://meuk.spritesserver.nl/foto/foto/hdhack/tmb-cachedemo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yep, there it is. Seems the cache is accessible by the Feroceons and
mapped to the 64MB DRAM region.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;prevnext&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://spritesmods.com/?art=hddhack&amp;amp;page=2&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;laquo Prev&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#xA0;3&amp;#xA0;&lt;a href=&quot;http://spritesmods.com/?art=hddhack&amp;amp;page=4&quot;&gt;Next &amp;#xBB;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;rdb-page-break&quot; /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
Ofcourse, if I wanted to change something in the cache, I couldn't
scan the complete 64MB of RAM every time: I needed to know how the
cache works. For that, I would need to dump, disassemble and understand
the hard disk firmware at least enough to make sense of the caching
functions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Disassembling this firmware is not a trivial task. First of all, the
code mixes ARM and thumb-style instructions, which is irritating if
you don't have a disassembler which can automatically switch between
the two. Furthermore, something that usually makes disassembling
software a lot easier is absent: Usually, routines are coded to spit
out messages like &quot;Couldn't open logfile! when something goes wrong.
These messages are a huge help in figuring out what a routine does.
This firmware, however, has none of these strings: you need to figure
out what a routine does purely by the code. The codebase seems to be
a bit old, though, and sometimes the disassembly feels like some features
have been 'bolted on' to the code later, making everything a bit more
complicated.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There also are a few things that make life easier, though. First of all,
it seems Western Digital hasn't been intentionally obfuscating the code:
no tricks like jumping in the middle of an instruction have been used.
Also, because the JTAG-interface is available, you can meddle with the
code, set breakpoints or change it on-the-fly, making figuring out what
routine gets run when immensely easier.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After a long time of staring at the code, trying to make sense of things
and sometimes jumping into the debugger to see if a guess was correct,
I managed to get to the core of the caching system: a table in RAM
I call the 'cache descriptor table':&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://meuk.spritesserver.nl/foto/foto/hdhack/cachestruct.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://meuk.spritesserver.nl/foto/foto/hdhack/tmb-cachestruct.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Every entry in the cache descriptor table describes a block in the
cache. It contains the start LBA of the disk sectors that are or 
should be cached, how much of the cache actually is filled with 
disk data, some flags indicating the state of the cache entry and a 
number indicating where in memory the cached data resides.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, with the secrets of the cache descriptor table unraveled, could
I intercept a disk read before it'd go out the SATA-port to the PC?
To do that, I'd need to be able to execute my own code on the hard
disk controller. Moreover, I would have to make sure the code
would get run on the correct time: if it modified the cache too soon,
the data wouldn't be in there yet; if it modified the cache too late,
the data would've already gone to the PC. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The way I did this was by hooking an existing routine. My hack would 
be in Feroceon 2, and that CPU did all the SATA transfers, so there must
be some routine that's responsible for setting up the SATA hardware
to pick up the data from cache. If I could find this routine, I could
perhaps run my own code before it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After a lot of browsing, setting breakpoints, failing and trying again,
I finally found some routine that fit the bill. I modified it to run
my code before it by hooking it. Here's the original code:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
000167BE ; r0 - slot in sata_req
000167BE sub_0_167BE:
000167BE                 PUSH    {R4-R7,LR}
000167C0                 MOVS    R7, R0
000167C2                 &lt;b&gt;LSLS    R1, R0, #4&lt;/b&gt;
000167C4                 &lt;b&gt;LDR     R0, =sata_req&lt;/b&gt;
000167C6                 &lt;b&gt;SUB     SP, SP, #0x14&lt;/b&gt;
000167C8                 &lt;b&gt;ADDS    R6, R1, R0&lt;/b&gt;
000167CA                 &lt;b&gt;LDRB    R1, [R6,#0xD]&lt;/b&gt;
000167CC                 LDR     R2, =stru_0_40028DC
000167CE                 STR     R1, [SP,#0x28+var_1C]
000167D0                 LDRB    R0, [R6,#(off_0_FFE3F108+2 - 0xFFE3F0FC)]
000167D2                 LDRB    R5, [R6,#(off_0_FFE3F108 - 0xFFE3F0FC)]
000167D4                 LSLS    R0, R0, #4
&lt;/pre&gt;

And here's what happens when the code is hooked to call my code:

&lt;pre&gt;
000167BE ; r0 - slot in sata_req
000167BE sub_0_167BE:
000167BE                 PUSH    {R4-R7,LR}
000167C0                 MOVS    R7, R0
000167C2                 &lt;i&gt;LD      R6, =hookedAddr&lt;/i&gt;
000167C4                 &lt;i&gt;BX      R6&lt;/i&gt;
000167C6                 &lt;i&gt;.dw     checksumFix&lt;/i&gt;
000167C8                 &lt;i&gt;.dd     hookedAddr&lt;/i&gt;
000167CC                 LDR     R2, =stru_0_40028DC
000167CE                 STR     R1, [SP,#0x28+var_1C]
000167D0                 LDRB    R0, [R6,#(off_0_FFE3F108+2 - 0xFFE3F0FC)]
000167D2                 LDRB    R5, [R6,#(off_0_FFE3F108 - 0xFFE3F0FC)]
000167D4                 LSLS    R0, R0, #4
...
FFE3F000                 PUSH    {R0-R12, LR}
FFE3F004                 BX      changeThingsInCache
FFE3F008                 POP     {R0-R12, LR}
FFE3F00C                 &lt;b&gt;LSLS    R1, R0, #4&lt;/b&gt;
FFE3F010                 &lt;b&gt;LDR     R0, =sata_req&lt;/b&gt;
FFE3F014                 &lt;b&gt;SUB     SP, SP, #0x14&lt;/b&gt;
FFE3F018                 &lt;b&gt;ADDS    R6, R1, R0&lt;/b&gt;
FFE3F01C                 &lt;b&gt;LDRB    R1, [R6,#0xD]&lt;/b&gt;
FFE3F020                 BX      0x167CC
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As you can see, some original instructions are replaced with a jump to
new code in an otherwise unused bit of ram at address 0xFFE3F000 and
an extra word to make sure the checksum of the code region still is 
valid. If this isn't done, the HD will try to load a backup from its 
platters, which isn't what we want. The code that's jumped to executes
a routine called changeThingsInCache and then does what the replaced
code would've done. It then continues execution in the original routine
like nothing has happened.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now all I need to write was a routine to modify the cached data. For a
first test, I decided on a routine that in pseudocode went something
like this:

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
void hook() {
  foreach (cache_struct in cache_struct_table) {
    if (is_valid(cache_struct)) {
      foreach (sector in cache_struct.sectors) {
        sector[0]=0x12345678;
      }
    }
  }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This little bit of code would replace the first 4 bytes of every
sector in cache with 0x12345678 every time it's called, so if I uploaded
all this to the hard disk, I should see that number on the start of
every sector I read. I uploaded the bits of code over JTAG...&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://meuk.spritesserver.nl/foto/foto/hdhack/1sthack_1.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://meuk.spritesserver.nl/foto/foto/hdhack/tmb-1sthack_1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
And lo and behold:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://meuk.spritesserver.nl/foto/foto/hdhack/1sthack_2.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://meuk.spritesserver.nl/foto/foto/hdhack/tmb-1sthack_2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;


&lt;p id=&quot;prevnext&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://spritesmods.com/?art=hddhack&amp;amp;page=3&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;laquo Prev&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#xA0;4&amp;#xA0;&lt;a href=&quot;http://spritesmods.com/?art=hddhack&amp;amp;page=5&quot;&gt;Next &amp;#xBB;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;rdb-page-break&quot; /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
Ofcourse, I could make this into a full hack, but needing to use
JTAG to poke it in RAM every time the hard disk boots would make it
pretty useless. I needed to make it persistant, that is, I needed to
store my modifications somewhere where it would be picked up again 
every time the hard disk powers on.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My location of choice was the flash rom. I could probably also have put
it somewhere in the reserved sectors on the disk itself, but if I messed
something up, I would have no way to recover my disk. The flash chip
is just an eight-pin standard part, so I could easily take it out, flash
it and put it in again. For that purpose, I desoldered it and put it
on a bit of veroboard, so I could easily switch it between a programmer
and the hard disk:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://meuk.spritesserver.nl/foto/foto/hdhack/IMG_2106.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://meuk.spritesserver.nl/foto/foto/hdhack/tmb-IMG_2106.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, what to put in the flash? Luckily, the format of what's stored
in the chip already has &lt;a href=&quot;http://nazyura.hardw.net/Part02.htm&quot;&gt;been figured out&lt;/a&gt;: it consists of multiple
blocks of data, with a table describing them at the very start. That
table describes the location of the block in flash, how it's compressed
(if it is compressed), the location where the block should be put
in RAM and, for the final address, an execution point where the loader
would jump to to start executing the program. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Unfortunately, I couldn't modify the code that was in the flash; the bits 
that contained the parts where I wanted to put my hooks was compressed with
an unknown compression algorithm, so I couldn't modify that. What I however
could do was add an extra block, and modify the execution address so that 
block would get executed before the rest. That made things a bit easier:
when 'my' block got executed, I could just code it to insert the hooks in the
now decompressed bits of code.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ofcourse, I had to dis- and re-assemble the flash binary for this. I created a
tool for that, unimaginatively called 'fwtool'. This tool can dump out the 
various blocks in the flash, plus translate the header into a text file for easy
modification. You can then modify, delete or add a block and re-assemble 
everything into a single firmware file, ready to be re-flashed. I used that to
add my custom bit of code to the image, flashed everything back to the chip,
put the chip back into the HD, booted everything back up and this was the
result:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://meuk.spritesserver.nl/foto/foto/hdhack/1sthack_2.png&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://meuk.spritesserver.nl/foto/foto/hdhack/tmb-1sthack_2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The result isn't that shocking: it's exactly the same as I had before. The trick is
that I didn't need the JTAG-rig to get it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;prevnext&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://spritesmods.com/?art=hddhack&amp;amp;page=4&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;laquo Prev&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#xA0;5&amp;#xA0;&lt;a href=&quot;http://spritesmods.com/?art=hddhack&amp;amp;page=6&quot;&gt;Next &amp;#xBB;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;rdb-page-break&quot; /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
While the flash mod was a good step forward, I still couldn't play out my 
imaginary hacker scenario: I don't think any server company accepts 'donations'
of hard disks with de- and re-soldered flash chips. I needed to find a way to
re-flash the chip while it was still soldered to the hard disk, preferably from
the PC the hard disk was connected to.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Western Digital firmware upgrade tools proves this is possible: it's 
basically a tool you run under DOS to put new firmware to both the flash and
the service area aka the reserved sectors of the hard disk. According to the
Internet, the tools use so-called Vendor Specific Commands to There are also some
other tools that can meddle with the firmware: for example, there is a bit of
proof-of-concept &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.recover.co.il/SA-cover/SA-cover.pdf&quot;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt;
that can use unused reserved sectors to hide away data. Finally, there's a set of
tools called &lt;a href=&quot;http://idle3-tools.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;idle3-tools&lt;/a&gt; that
can be used to modify a byte in the firmware to modift the idle behaviour of the
hard disk. This code also uses VSCs, and does this using the 'official' way
using Linux scsi passthrough ioctls. I decided to 'borrow' this code, modify it
a bit and integrate it in fwtool. After some messing around and guessing VSC
parameters, fwtool could all of a sudden also read and write the flash
of a HD attached to the PC it's run on.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With this, my attack was complete. If a blackhat hacker had somehow
obtained root access to a server with this drive, he could use fwtool to remotely 
dump the flash of the disk, modify it and flash it back. Eventually, the owner of
the box will find out I am using his box for nefarious purposes and will probably
re-install the system, securing the way the hacker orginally entered the machine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With the firmware hack in place, however, the attacker could tell the hard disk 
to do something nefarious with the new install. He'd need to trigger that 
behaviour first, though, and that could be done  by writing a certain magic string 
the firmware hack would look for to the disk. The magic string can be in any file; 
the attacker could for example upload a .jpeg-file with the string in it to the 
server. He could also request a file from the webserver with the magic string 
appended to the URL. That would eventually end up in the logs of the machines, 
triggering the exploit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The hard disk firmware hack would then do something nefarious. For example, it 
could wait for the machine to read out the file /etc/shadow, where all the passwords
are stored on an Unix/Linux system, and modify the contents on-the-fly to something
the attacker hardcoded earlier. When the attacker would then try to log into the
system with his own password, the machine would check this password against the
now-modified /etc/shadow and the attacker would be free to login again.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here's the demonstration I did at the presentation. You can see me try to log into 
the root account of the machine unsuccessfully. I then enable the hack and give it
a replacement password hash, namely for the password 'test123'. Because Linux 
caches the shadow file (like all files recently accessed), I have to generate a lot
of disk activity for the file to be 'pushed out' of the cache; that way, when I try 
to login again, Linux will be forced to fetch the shadow file from disk again. 
Finally, with the cache cleared, I can just log into the root account with the
faked test123 password.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;video width=&quot;456&quot; height=&quot;344&quot;&gt;&lt;source src=&quot;http://spritesmods.com/hddhack/demo-pass.ogv&quot; type=&quot;video/ogg&quot;&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;p id=&quot;prevnext&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://spritesmods.com/?art=hddhack&amp;amp;page=5&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;laquo Prev&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#xA0;6&amp;#xA0;&lt;a href=&quot;http://spritesmods.com/?art=hddhack&amp;amp;page=7&quot;&gt;Next &amp;#xBB;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;rdb-page-break&quot; /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
Ofcourse, restoring access to servers which had their clandestine entry methods 
removed isn't the only useful way my reverse engineering efforts can be used for.
It can also be used for defensive purposes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For example, you could make an un-clonable hard disk: the hard disk would act 
normal if the access pattern for the sectors was somewhat random, like a normal OS
would access a filesystem. If the disk was accessed only sequentially, like a
disk cloning utility would do, the hard disk could mangle the data, making the clone
different from the original.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The disk controller is also interesting as a generic controller board. You have
three fairly capable CPU cores, with a pretty big amount of RAM connected to it.
There's also an uart, for the serial port, and at least two SPI interfaces; one
to the flash rom and one to the spindle controllers. You can load the code for 
the processor by updating an external flash chip, or even by using the serial port
in the bootloader. To demonstrate the power of the chip, I ported a fairly
ubiquitous bit of software to my HD. The demo is a proof-of-concept only, the
serial port is the only peripherial that works, and no userspace is available yet.
Nevertheless, I am still a bit proud to say I have installed Linux on my hard disk.
On top, a standard command line (the HD is mounted under /mnt), on the bottom the
output of my work on the serial port of the hard disk:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;video width=&quot;456&quot; height=&quot;344&quot;&gt;&lt;source src=&quot;http://spritesmods.com/hddhack/demo-linux.ogv&quot; type=&quot;video/ogg&quot;&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A bit more explanation about what happens here: the kernel and init
are both packed in pieces with the size of exactly one sector, with
a magic string and order number prepended. By reading the file from
the disk, it will end up in the cache of the disk. The write of the
magic string 'HD, lnx!' finally triggers the modified firmware to
search the cache for all the sectors, re-assemble the kernel image
and boots it. The kernel is built for a MMU-less CPU (the disk 
controller doesn't have one) and only has a driver for the serial
port. A MMU-less kernel unfortunately needs a specially formatted
bit of userspace too. I couldn't get this to compile, so the kernel
finally panics because it can't find an init it can execute.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;prevnext&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://spritesmods.com/?art=hddhack&amp;amp;page=6&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;laquo Prev&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#xA0;7&amp;#xA0;&lt;a href=&quot;http://spritesmods.com/?art=hddhack&amp;amp;page=8&quot;&gt;Next &amp;#xBB;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;rdb-page-break&quot; /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
So, there you have it. While the hard disk controller is a beast without much data 
known about it, it's still perfectly well possible to reverse engineer it and to
write custom code for it. The unknown-ness of the controller does make it harder
to write generic hacks, which makes me doubtfull that a thing like the evil 
firmware patch will ever be seen in the wild: it's much easier to just get another
zero-day software exploit than reverse engineer the firmware of every single hard
disk every server you stumble upon has.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I also hope to have proven that a broken hard disk is something you can still use. 
While the mechanics of a broken HD probably are shot, the PCB still contains an 
usable embedded system, which actually is pretty powerful considering you can usually
get broken hard disks for free.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Releasing the source-code for a security project always is a nasty subject. I want to
release code, but I do not want to be responsible for a lot of permanently hacked
servers... I decided to compromise: you can download the code I used 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://spritesmods.com/hddhack/hddhack.tgz&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but I removed the shadow-replacement code.
Make note: I'm not going to support the process to get all this running in any way;
it's a hack, you figure it out.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id=&quot;prevnext&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://spritesmods.com/?art=hddhack&amp;amp;page=7&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;laquo Prev&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#xA0;8&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0 comments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;leavecmt&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;rdb-page-break&quot; /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Apart from this article, I also gave a talk at 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://ohm2013.org/&quot;&gt;OHM2013&lt;/a&gt; about this subject. As soon
as the video recordings made at that time are available, I'll link there.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://meuk.spritesserver.nl/foto/foto/hdhack/IMG_2286.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://meuk.spritesserver.nl/foto/foto/hdhack/tmb-IMG_2286.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Hard disks: if you read this, it's pretty much certain you use one
or more of the things. They're pretty simple: they basically present
a bunch of 512-byte sectors, numbered by an increasing address, 
also known as the LBA or Logical Block Address. The
PC the HD is connected to can read or write data to and from these 
sectors. Usually, a file system is used that abstracts all those
sectors to files and folders.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you look at an HD from that naive standpoint, you would think
the hardware should be pretty simple: all you need is something that
connects to a SATA-port which can then position the read/write-head
and read or write data from or to the platters. But maybe more is 
involved: don't hard disks also handle bad block management and
SMART attributes, and don't they usually have some cache they must
somehow manage?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All that implies there's some intelligence in an hard disk, and
intelligence usually implies hackability. I'm always interested
in hackability, so I decided I wanted to look into how hard disks
work on the non-mechanical level. Research like this has been done
before for various bits of hardware: from PCI extension cards to
embedded controllers in laptops to even Apple keyboards. Usually
the research has been done in order to prove the hackability of these
devices can lead to compromised software, so I decided to take the same
approach: for this hack, I wanted to make a hard disk that could bypass
software security.
&lt;/p&gt;

Samsung agency is buying off StackOverflow users

</link>
<description>
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;eight columns&quot;&gt;
	
	
	&lt;p&gt;I love StackOverflow. I really do. Recently, I've had way too much free time on my hands and I've been accruing Internet Points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/users/282398/delyan&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/users/flair/282398.png?theme=clean&quot; width=&quot;208&quot; alt=&quot;profile for Delyan at Stack Overflow, Q&amp;amp;A for professional and enthusiast programmers&quot; title=&quot;profile for Delyan at Stack Overflow, Q&amp;amp;A for professional and enthusiast programmers&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of that is from the Android tag. What can I say? I enjoy &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10792136/classcastexception-while-dynamically-loading-a-class-in-android/17903555#17903555&quot;&gt;tracking down class loading problems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, that caught the attention of John Yoon, who left a comment on &lt;a href=&quot;http://delyan.me/05-22-2013/an-improved-sliding-pane-for-android/#disqus_thread&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi Delyan,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found you via Stackoverflow. Sorry I am writing in the comment section but I couldn't find an email address. I was wondering if you would be interested in doing a small partnership to promote the upcoming Samsung Smart App Challenge. We need guys that know about Android Apps on Stackoverflow. So if you are interested please email me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:john@fllu.com&quot;&gt;john@fllu.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was super excited! I'm new to this blog game and this comment is validating both my blog &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; my StackOverflow efforts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I shot back this brisque email, thinking they need someone to provide support in their forums, or help out teams or do the challenge or&amp;#x2026; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi John,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You recently got in touch at my blog (delyan.me) asking if I was interested in doing something with the Samsung Smart App Challenge. I'll cut to the chase - what's the challenge, what would be my participation in it, what's the timeframe and why me? :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks,
-- Delyan
Sent from my phone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having seen the title of this post, you can probably guess how he replied (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi Delyan,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are in charge of getting the word out about SSAC (Samsung Smart App Challenge) for Stackoverflow.  There are a lot of Android App developers on the site that don't even know about the contest.  The contest is pretty big.  You can check out the details for the contest here.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smartappchallenge.com&quot;&gt;www.smartappchallenge.com&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;strong&gt;We contacted members that we feel know something about Androids and Android Apps.&lt;/strong&gt;  Also those that are ACTIVE on Stackoverflow...  All we need you to do is talk about the SSAC (Samsung Smart App Challenge) and get the word out.  How?  &lt;strong&gt;We were thinking about 4 questions on Stackoverflow over the span of a month..... as well as replies to posts made by other members.&lt;/strong&gt;  Don't worry about finding the questions to reply to because &lt;strong&gt;we will send you links&lt;/strong&gt;.  We don't want to SPAM...I repeat we don't want you to spam the message boards with links to the contest.  &lt;strong&gt;The questions should be casual and organic.  Like &quot;Anyone know anything about SSAC?  or...&quot;Need some feedback on the app I am about to enter for the Samsung Smart App Challenge.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;  You have a dialogue with people that reply.  That is it!  4 questions spread out over a month (August 31st is the deadline to enter).  Replies to others posts about the SSAC (you will get responses because we have other members doing the same thing you are doing).  We are willing to pay $500 just for that.  Not a lot of work...since you are involved in Stackoverflow ANYWAY.  If you are still interested please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:john@fllu.com&quot;&gt;john@fllu.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I put this politely?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, it's clear that this guy is totally out-of-touch with what StackOverflow is - if anyone posted &quot;questions&quot; like that on StackOverflow, they'd be downvoted to -&amp;#x221E;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, it insulting to me to expect that I'd violate the community I've put so much effort into for a few bucks. Had they approached me to ask that I promote the competition &lt;em&gt;legitimately&lt;/em&gt;, I would've been happy to do it out of goodwill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, &lt;em&gt;&quot;Androids&quot;&lt;/em&gt;?! Really?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this isn't Samsung's fault directly but please, please help me prevent FLLU and Samsung from getting away with this! Spread the word, don't let them undermine the few good communities we've created out there on the interwebz!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've notified StackExchange, hopefully they can do something about it on their end.&lt;/p&gt;

Volvo Gave Away the Most Important Design They Ever Patented
</title>

</link>
<description>
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogContent&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3uusn7/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://s3.amazonaws.com/pix-media/blog/357/ScreenShot2013-08-01at9.49.33AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;720&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1958, people rarely buckled up. While race car drivers and fighter pilots wore harnesses, the seat belts available in cars simply banded across one's lap. In crashes, they frequently did more harm than good. The sudden pressure put on the abdomen during a crash &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/three-point-seatbelt-inventor-nils-bohlin-born&quot;&gt;caused&lt;/a&gt; internal injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, Volvo was already pushing its brand as a safety conscious automaker. Its CEO, whose relative had recently died in a car crash, decided to hire Nils Bohlin, a man who had previously designed ejector seats for fighter jets, as chief safety engineer (a new position).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bohlin turned his attention to seat belts. He had worked with four point harnesses in fighter jets, but doubted that consumers would use such a bulky contraption. &quot;It was just a matter of finding a solution that was simple, effective and could be put on conveniently with one hand,&quot; he later &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/three-point-seatbelt-inventor-nils-bohlin-born&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1959, Volvo delivered its first car that used Bohlin's answer, a three point seat belt that can be seen in the above image and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/autopia/2009/08/strapping-success-the-3-point-seatbelt-turns-50/&quot;&gt;every car&lt;/a&gt; sold today. Volvo received a patent for the design in 1962, but rather than hoard it, they gave it to the world. Volvo&amp;#xA0;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seat_belt#Three-point&quot;&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt; the design, allowed any carmaker to use it, and sent Bohlin on a world tour to encourage its use.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next decades, accolades rolled in. Britain&amp;#x2019;s Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8197875.stm&quot;&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; that Bohlin's 3 point seat belt has saved over 1 million lives. German patent registrars &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/autopia/2009/08/strapping-success-the-3-point-seatbelt-turns-50/&quot;&gt;named&lt;/a&gt; it one of the 8 most significant patents of the century - an honor shared with inventors like Thomas Edison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of how Volvo made their life saving patent available to the world (they called it an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2009/08/11/473711.html&quot;&gt;&quot;open patent&quot;&lt;/a&gt;) is a nice one. By showing the counterfactual, it's also a reminder of what happens when companies do not pull a Volvo and keep their life saving inventions locked up behind patents.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While enforcing patents can seem grinch-like, they do incentivize research to make valuable discoveries in the first place. And as sharing the 3 point seat belt design fit with Volvo's branding, they had an easier path to the classy move of giving it away. (Hoarding it would also have hurt their safety-conscious brand.) But this reminds us of the importance of policing overzealous patents, and looking for opportunities to incentivize discoveries without the need for patents when&amp;#xA0;&lt;a href=&quot;http://priceonomics.com/open-science-vs-intellectual-property/&quot;&gt;appropriate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also serves as a reminder of the consequences of enforcing patents for life saving designs or breakthroughs when they seem appropriate. The decision to enforce that patent, even if justifiable, is still a choice.&amp;#xA0;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hollywood_Sign_PB050006.jpg&quot;&gt;This post was written by Alex Mayyasi.

      &lt;h3&gt;Minimal&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linux kernel + systemd.&lt;/strong&gt; That's about it. CoreOS has just enough bits to run containers, but does not ship a package manager itself. In fact, the root partition is completely read-only, to guarantee consistency and make updates reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-lg-4 value-prop&quot;&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;Docker compatible&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Built for containers.&lt;/strong&gt; Use docker as a package manager to build and push your app. The primitive of an application is a container, not a one-off package. Build containers using docker, by hand, or however you see fit!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-lg-4 value-prop&quot;&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;Service discovery&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clustered by default.&lt;/strong&gt; Built in service discovery and configuration sharing using the Raft distributed consensus algorithm. CoreOS is made for companies building platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

Google Pressure Cookers and Backpacks, Get a Visit from the Feds
</title>

<description>
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;

            
            &lt;p&gt;
	Michele Catalano was looking for information online about pressure cookers. Her husband, in the same time frame, was Googling backpacks. Wednesday morning, six men from a joint terrorism task force showed up at their house to see if they were terrorists. Which begs the question: How'd the government know what they were Googling?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Catalano (who is a professional writer) &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/something-like-falling/2e7d13e54724&quot;&gt;describes&lt;/a&gt; the tension of that visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	[T]hey were peppering my husband with questions. Where is he from? Where are his parents from? They asked about me, where was I, where do I work, where do my parents live. &lt;em&gt;Do you have any bombs&lt;/em&gt;, they asked. Do you own a pressure cooker? My husband said no, but we have a rice cooker. Can you make a bomb with that? My husband said no, my wife uses it to make quinoa. What the hell is quinoa, they asked. ...&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have you ever looked up how to make a pressure cooker bomb?&lt;/em&gt; My husband, ever the oppositional kind, asked them if they themselves weren&amp;#x2019;t curious as to how a pressure cooker bomb works, if they ever looked it up. Two of them admitted they did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The men identified themselves as members of the &quot;joint terrorism task force.&quot; The composition of such task forces &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/terrorism/terrorism_jttfs&quot;&gt;depend on the region of the country&lt;/a&gt;, but, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2013/04/boston-investigation-agencies/64333/&quot;&gt;we outlined&lt;/a&gt; after the Boston bombings, include a variety of federal agencies. Among them: the FBI and Homeland Security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ever since details of the NSA's surveillance infrastructure were leaked by Edward Snowden, the agency has been insistent on the boundaries of the information it collects. It is not, by law, allowed to spy on Americans &amp;#x2014;&amp;#xA0;although there are exceptions of which it takes advantage. Its PRISM program, under which it collects internet content, does not include information from Americans unless those Americans are connected to terror suspects by no more than &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2013/07/nsa-admits-it-analyzes-more-peoples-data-previously-revealed/67287/&quot;&gt;two other people&lt;/a&gt;. It collects metadata on phone calls made by Americans, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2013/06/nsa-emails-stellarwind/66658/&quot;&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; stopped collecting metadata on Americans' internet use in 2011. So how, then, would the government know what Catalano and her husband were searching for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It's possible that one of the two of them is tangentially linked to a foreign terror suspect, allowing the government to review their internet activity. After all, that &quot;no more than two other people&quot; ends up &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/3-hops-nsa-gets-millions-phone-records-204851967.html&quot;&gt;covering millions of people&lt;/a&gt;. Or perhaps the NSA, as part of its routine collection of as much internet traffic as it can, automatically flags things like Google searches for &quot;pressure cooker&quot; and &quot;backpack&quot; and passes on anything it finds to the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Or maybe it was something else. On Wednesday, &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2013/07/its-easy-nsa-spy-your-entire-internet-life/67820/&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on XKeyscore, a program &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2013/07/which-better-nsas-search-or-facebooks/67838/&quot;&gt;eerily similar to Facebook search&lt;/a&gt; that could clearly allow an analyst to run a search that picked out people who'd done searches for those items from the same location. How those searches got into the government's database is a question worth asking; how the information got back out seems apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is also possible that there were other factors that prompted the government's interest in Catalano and her husband. He travels to Asia, she notes in her article. Who knows. Which is largely Catalano's point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	They mentioned that they do this about 100 times a week. And that 99 of those visits turn out to be nothing. I don&amp;#x2019;t know what happens on the other 1% of visits and I&amp;#x2019;m not sure I want to know what my neighbors are up to.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One hundred times a week, groups of six armed men drive to houses in three black SUVs, conducting consented-if-casual searches of the property perhaps in part because of things people looked up online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But the NSA doesn't collect data on Americans, so this certainly won't happen to you.&lt;/p&gt;

Heart Surgery in India for $1,583 Costs $106,385 in U.S.
</title>

<description>
&lt;div&gt;
        &lt;div id=&quot;story_display&quot;&gt;
          
          
            &lt;p&gt;Devi Shetty is obsessed with making
heart surgery affordable for millions of Indians. On his office
desk are photographs of two of his heroes: Mother Teresa and
Mahatma Gandhi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shetty is not a public health official motivated by
charity. He&amp;#x2019;s a heart surgeon turned businessman who has started
a chain of 21 medical &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.narayanahospitals.com/&quot; title=&quot;Open Web Site&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;centers&lt;/a&gt; around India. By trimming costs
with such measures as buying cheaper scrubs and spurning air-conditioning, he has cut the price of artery-clearing coronary
bypass surgery to 95,000 rupees ($1,583), half of what it was 20
years ago, and wants to get the price down to $800 within a
decade. The same procedure costs $106,385 at &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.bloomberg.com/ohio/&quot;&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#x2019;s Cleveland
Clinic, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/Inpatient.html&quot; title=&quot;Open Web Site&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the U.S. Centers for Medicare &amp;amp;
Medicaid Services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;It shows that costs can be substantially contained,&amp;#x201D;
said Srinath Reddy, president of the Geneva-based World Heart
Federation, of Shetty&amp;#x2019;s approach. &amp;#x201C;It&amp;#x2019;s possible to deliver
very high quality cardiac care at a relatively low cost.&amp;#x201D; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical experts like Reddy are watching closely, eager to
see if Shetty&amp;#x2019;s driven cost-cutting can point the way for
hospitals to boost revenue on a wider scale by making life-saving heart operations more accessible to potentially millions
of people in India and other developing countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;The current price of everything that you see in health
care is predominantly opportunistic pricing and the outcome of
inefficiency,&amp;#x201D; Shetty, 60, said in an interview in his office
in Bangalore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Out-of-Pocket &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cutting costs is especially vital in &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.bloomberg.com/india/&quot;&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, where more than
two-thirds of the population lives on less than $2 a day and &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.OOPC.ZS&quot; title=&quot;Open Web Site&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;86
percent&lt;/a&gt; of health care is paid out of pocket by individuals. A
recent study by the Public Health Foundation of India and the
London School of Hygiene &amp;amp; Tropical Medicine found that in India
non-communicable ailments such as heart disease are now more
common among the poor than the rich. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One in four people there die of a heart attack and per-capita health spending is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/gho/countries/ind.pdf&quot; title=&quot;Open Web Site&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;less than $60&lt;/a&gt; a year. Yet the country
performs only 100,000 to 120,000 heart surgeries each year, well
short of the 2 million Shetty estimates are needed. The
mortality rate from coronary artery disease among South Asians
is two to three times higher than that of Caucasians, according
to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2605339/&quot; title=&quot;Open Web Site&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in 2008 in the journal Vascular Health and
Risk Management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dietary Patterns &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;There has been fast urbanization in India that&amp;#x2019;s brought
with it a change in dietary patterns and lifestyle,&amp;#x201D; said Usha
Shrivastava, head of public health at the National Diabetes,
Obesity and Cholesterol Foundation. &amp;#x201C;It&amp;#x2019;s leading to this huge
jump in cardiovascular disease.&amp;#x201D; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average age for a first heart attack in India, &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.bloomberg.com/pakistan/&quot;&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;
and other South Asian nations was 53 years, compared with 58.8
years in countries outside the region, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17227980&quot; title=&quot;Open Web Site&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;
published in 2007 in the Journal of the American Medical
Association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest impediment for heart surgery in India is
accessibility. Shetty aims to bridge that by building hospitals
outside India&amp;#x2019;s main cities. He said he plans to add 30,000 beds
over the next decade to the 6,000 the hospital chain has
currently, and has identified 100 towns with populations of
500,000 to 1 million that have no heart hospital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 300-bed, pre-fabricated, single-story hospital in the
city of Mysore cost $6 million and took six months for
construction company Larsen &amp;amp; Toubro Ltd. to build, Shetty said.
Only the hospital&amp;#x2019;s operating theaters and intensive-care units
are air-conditioned, to reduce energy costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Changing Procedures &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the ways in which Shetty is able to keep his prices
low is by cutting out unnecessary pre-op testing, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urine samples that were once routine before surgery were
eliminated when it was found that only a handful of cases tested
positive for harmful bacteria. The chain uses web-based computer
software to run logistics, rather than licensing or building
expensive new systems for each hospital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Shetty couldn&amp;#x2019;t convince a European manufacturer to
bring down the price of its disposable surgical gowns and drapes
to a level affordable for his hospitals, he convinced a group of
young entrepreneurs in Bangalore to make them so he could buy
them 60 percent cheaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, Shetty sees costs coming down further as
more Asian electronics companies enter the market for CT
scanners, MRIs and catheterization labs -- bringing down prices.
As India trains more diploma holders in specialties such as
anesthesiology, gynecology, ophthalmology and radiology,
Narayana will be able to hire from a larger, less expensive
talent pool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One positive unforeseen outcome may be that many of the
cost-saving approaches could be duplicated in developed
economies, especially in the U.S. under health reform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;Global health-care costs are rising rapidly and as
countries move toward universal health coverage, they will have
to face the challenge of providing health care at a fairly
affordable cost,&amp;#x201D; said the World Heart Federation&amp;#x2019;s Reddy, a
New Delhi-based cardiologist who is also president of the Public
Health Foundation of India. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
           
              
              &lt;p&gt;This morning, MIT released a report into Aaron Swartz&amp;#x2019;s death. Here is the statement I just released in response:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tuesday, 30 July 2013&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CONTACT:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brett Abrams&amp;#xA0;: 516-841-1105&amp;#xA0;: brett@fitzgibbonmedia.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aaron Swartz&amp;#x2019;s Partner Slams MIT Report As a Whitewash&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statement by Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman, on MIT&amp;#x2019;s report, released today, on the University&amp;#x2019;s actions in the Aaron Swartz case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&quot;MIT&amp;#x2019;s behavior throughout the case was reprehensible, and this report is quite frankly a whitewash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here are the facts: This report claims that MIT was &amp;#x201C;neutral&amp;#x201D; &amp;#x2014; but MIT&amp;#x2019;s lawyers gave prosecutors total access to witnesses and evidence, while refusing access to Aaron&amp;#x2019;s lawyers to the exact same witnesses and evidence. That&amp;#x2019;s not neutral. The fact is that all MIT had to do was say publicly, &amp;#x201C;We don&amp;#x2019;t want this prosecution to go forward&amp;#x201D; &amp;#x2013; and Steve Heymann and Carmen Ortiz would have had no case. We have an institution to contrast MIT with &amp;#x2013; JSTOR, who came out immediately and publicly against the prosecution. Aaron would be alive today if MIT had acted as JSTOR did. MIT had a moral imperative to do so.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;And even now, MIT is still stonewalling. Wired reporter Kevin Poulsen FOIA&amp;#x2019;d the Secret Service&amp;#x2019;s files on Aaron&amp;#x2019;s case, and judge ordered them to be released. The only reason they haven&amp;#x2019;t been is because MIT has filed an objection. If MIT is at all serious about implementing any reforms to stop this kind of tragedy from happening again, it must stop objecting to the release of information about the case.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;You should follow me on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TarenSK&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body&quot;&gt;


	        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://b-i.forbesimg.com/andygreenberg/files/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-31-at-10.15.06-AM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignright  wp-image-11305&quot; src=&quot;http://b-i.forbesimg.com/andygreenberg/files/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-31-at-10.15.06-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;420&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;When NSA Director Keith Alexander appeared at the Las Vegas security conference Black Hat Wednesday morning, he hoped to mend the NSA&amp;#x2019;s reputation in the eyes of thousands of the conference&amp;#x2019;s hackers and security professionals. It didn&amp;#x2019;t go exactly as planned.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Alexander was about a half hour into his talk when a 30-year-old security consultant named Jon McCoy shouted &amp;#x201C;Freedom!&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;Exactly,&amp;#x201D; responded Alexander. &amp;#x201C;We stand for freedom.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;Bullshit!&amp;#x201D; McCoy shouted.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;Not bad,&amp;#x201D; Alexander said, as applause broke out in the crowd. &amp;#x201C;But I think what you&amp;#x2019;re saying is that in these cases, what&amp;#x2019;s the distinction, where&amp;#x2019;s the discussion and what tools do we have to stop this.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;No, I&amp;#x2019;m saying I don&amp;#x2019;t trust you!&amp;#x201D; shouted McCoy.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;You lied to Congress. Why would people believe you&amp;#x2019;re not lying to us right now?&amp;#x201D; another voice in the crowd added.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;I haven&amp;#x2019;t lied to Congress,&amp;#x201D; Alexander responded, visibly tensing. &amp;#x201C;I do think it&amp;#x2019;s important for us to have this discussion. Because in my opinion, what you believe is what&amp;#x2019;s written in the press without looking at the facts. This is the greatest technical center of gravity in the world. I ask that you all look at those facts.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Alexander&amp;#x2019;s talk had begun with a plea for the hacker and security researcher community to reconsider the NSA&amp;#x2019;s role in the wake of a still-unfolding scandal revealed by the classified leaks of former Booz Allen contractor Edward Snowden. &amp;#x201C;Their reputation has been tarnished,&amp;#x201D; he said, speaking of his NSA staff. &amp;#x201C;But you can help us articulate the facts properly. I will answer every question to the fullest extent possible, and I promise you the truth: What I know, what we&amp;#x2019;re doing, and what I cannot tell you because we don&amp;#x2019;t want to jeopardize the future of our defense.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Alexander&amp;#x2019;s talk focused on the oversight placed on the NSA by Congress and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which must approve the NSA&amp;#x2019;s surveillance in any case where it might target Americans. The FISC, which hears the NSA&amp;#x2019;s arguments without any opposing counsel, has been accused of offering negligible oversight of the Agency&amp;#x2019;s work.&amp;#xA0;The FISC&amp;#xA0;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fas.org/irp/agency/doj/fisa/2012rept.pdf&quot;&gt;stated in April that it had received 1,789 applications for electronic surveillance&lt;/a&gt;, of which 1,748 others were approved without changes and only one was withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;I&amp;#x2019;ve heard the court is a rubber stamp. I&amp;#x2019;m on the other end of that table, against that table of judges that don&amp;#x2019;t take any&amp;#x2014;I&amp;#x2019;m trying to think of a word here&amp;#x2014;from even a four-star general. They want to make sure what we&amp;#x2019;re doing comports with the constitution and the law,&amp;#x201D; Alexander said. &amp;#x201C;I can tell you from the wire brushings I&amp;#x2019;ve received, they are not a rubber&amp;#xA0; stamp.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Alexander also cited a Congressional inquiry into the NSA that found no evidence that it had engaged in any illegal use of its spying powers. But the NSA has come under continued Congressional scrutiny, including in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2013/07/31/senators-question-nsa-hoovering-of-phone-records/&quot;&gt;hearing Wednesday morning in which the Senate Judiciary committee grilled members of the intelligence community&lt;/a&gt;, including NSA deputy director John Inglis, over the mass collection of Americans&amp;#x2019; cell phone records. Also Wednesday morning, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/31/nsa-top-secret-program-online-data&quot;&gt;Guardian published new documents leaked by Edward Snowden revealing yet another NSA program known as XKeyScore&lt;/a&gt;, a tool that allows the broad search of millions of individuals&amp;#x2019; emails and browsing history.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In his Black Hat talk, the four-star general presented a timeline of terrorist attacks around the world, from the 1993 World Trade Center bombing to the Boston Marathon attack. He told the story of Najibullah Zazi, a terrorist accused of plotting an attack on the New York subway whose plot was foiled by the NSA&amp;#x2019;s surveillance, particularly the PRISM program that allows the NSA access to user data from Google, Microsoft, Apple, Skype, Facebook and other tech firms.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Alexander also noted the 6,000 NSA cryptologists who have deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq, 20 of whom were killed in the line of duty according to Alexander. &amp;#x201C;Think about people willing to go forward to Iraq and Afghanistan, to make sure our soldiers, airmen and marines get the intelligence they need,&amp;#x201D; he said. &amp;#x201C;I believe these are the most noble people we have in this country.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;We get all these allegations of what [NSA staff] could be doing,&amp;#x201D; Alexander added. &amp;#x201C;But when people check what the NSA is doing, they&amp;#x2019;ve found zero times that&amp;#x2019;s happened. And that&amp;#x2019;s no bullshit. Those are the facts.&amp;#x201D; The crowd responded to that line with loud applause, as Alexander asked the press not to quote his swearing, noting his 15 grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;The whole reason I came here was to ask you to help you to help us make it better,&amp;#x201D; said the general. &amp;#x201C;And if you disagree with what we&amp;#x2019;re doing, you should help us twice as much.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;



        &lt;/div&gt;

	        &lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;Read the constitution!&amp;#x201D; shouted McCoy in one last heckle.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;I have. So should you,&amp;#x201D; responded Alexander to another round of applause.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;After the talk, I found McCoy in the crowd and asked him about his not-so-friendly debate with the general. &amp;#x201C;His speech was pretty canned,&amp;#x201D; said McCoy. &amp;#x201C;It&amp;#x2019;s anything you can see on Fox News any day. We&amp;#x2019;re in danger, we have to get rid of your freedom to keep you safe.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;Everyone&amp;#x2019;s thinking this, but no one&amp;#x2019;s saying it public, so everyone thinks they&amp;#x2019;re alone,&amp;#x201D; he said. &amp;#x201C;Ninety-eight percent of society has issues with this&amp;#x2026;But no one speaks up.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;

Two Stories of Passive Income Excess
</title>

&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;stack-el&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two Stories of Passive Income Excess&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &amp;#xA0;&amp;#xA0;
      &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/share&quot; class=&quot;twitter-share-button&quot;&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;These stories cropped up in the Hacker News comments to a post I made on 7.30.13. I was riveted, but felt that they got lost in the noise. I'm reposting them here as I think they deserve another read.&lt;/i&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
		1. &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=willholloway&quot;&gt;Will Holloway&lt;/a&gt; 
	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&quot;In my college days I had dreams of passive income, because I wanted to self-fund a career as a writer/director of micro-budget indie movies.
	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		A friend told me about a friend who claimed to be making loads with affiliate marketing, so I started to immerse myself in performance marketing, the lifestyle was just too attractive.
	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		I started with a $100 FB ads coupon and by the time that was spent I luckily stumbled on a profitable campaign.
	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		I quickly realized that the globalized economy is extremely competitive, and internet businesses with low barriers to entry are radically hyper competitive.
	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		There was no way to be completely passive and successful.
	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		So I obsessively scaled my profitable campaigns and researched and experimented with new ones. I went to conferences, and sought to strike better deals with affiliate networks and even sought direct deals with the companies whose products I was selling.
	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		I spent a lot of time building relationships with the ad reps of the companies I was buying ad space from.
	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		I did a lot of industrial intelligence to find what was working and what wasn't.
	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		My girlfriend at the time was finishing her last year of college and I did all of this while she was at class. When she finished school we embarked on a cross country trip, went to a lot of music festivals and moved to Boulder, CO.
	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		It was a pretty sweet lifestyle for a while.
	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		The money was still coming in from my old campaigns, but the distraction of being on a permanent working vacation took a toll on my efforts.
		Then the industry kind of imploded. The field got incredibly more competitive and a lot of affiliates began engaging in outright fraud to increase conversions.
	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		Because of the unethical behavior, the companies I was buying traffic from started making it harder for affiliates to operate, they wanted national brands as advertisers and I don't blame them.
	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		The industry was scummy, not so much because the conferences I went to had their opening night festivities at strip clubs. Or that even at the relatively more respectable events naked women wearing only paint would serve drinks.
	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		It was just corrupted by the huge amounts of easy money made possible by the implosion of the global economy and the resulting plummeting of ad rates combined with the deceptive marketing practices employed by the affiliates.
	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		When more and more people heard about the easy money available, only the sociopaths or otherwise ethically impaired could profit.
	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		My dreams of easy passive income were dashed and I threw myself into software development. Now I create real value, instead of exploiting narrow arbitrage opportunities.
	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		Making amazing software products is so much more valuable, rewarding and sane than film making anyhow.
	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		To answer your question, is it possible? Yes it is, but it is very dependent on market conditions and they are forever trending to be less favorable.
	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		There are still incredible opportunities in lead gen (better connotations than affiliate marketing) but these days you have to build a platform that delivers real value instead of just buying cheap traffic and selling it for more.
	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		My most poignant memory from the time was being a part of a circle of festival goers holding a large circular nylon parachute that caught and launched a seemingly infinite series of glow sticks into the air in a fountain like manner at Rothbury on July 4th 2009 during a Grateful Dead set.
	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		The money from that period is long gone, and so is the girl but the memories and skills remain.
	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		Ill share one more story about the ethics of the industry because it's worth it:
	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		An acquaintance in the biz once bribed a Facebook employee whose job it was to approve or deny ads on the platform. His inside man set his account to auto approve any ad he wanted.
	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		He used that to get the scummiest, most downright fraudulent ads he could up.
	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		He told me that he made $80,000 in 4 days by placing ads like 'Google is hiring, apply here' that led to credit card re-bill free trials for how to make money from home info products.
	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		The bribed employee was led out of the building after four days of this.
		I had always wanted to write a book about this industry titled &quot;Internet Bandits&quot;, it was quite fascinating. There was a time when a kid with a credit card, poor ethics and some basic web design skills could make $50,000 a month.&quot;
	&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
		&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6128111&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
		2. &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ZiadHilal&quot;&gt;Ziad Hilal&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&quot;Studied CS at university for 2 years, dropped out to pursue an idea. After a couple years of work, I was bringing in 20k a month.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
		It was the most incredible time of my life. It lasted for 7 years before it hit the bottom. During that time I spent my days playing beach volleyball, tennis, golf, skateboarding, gaming, girls, beautiful car/apartment, the life in Santa Monica CA!
	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

		I wasn't the least bit afraid when the project/business started slowing down. I decided to launch two more ideas - BOTH FAILED. At that point I was burnt out and was running low on savings. I had no other choice but find employment. In my mind, I failed and lost everything. It hurt me for years, and still hurts me to this day.
	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

		While I have a great job, the feeling of imprisonment and failure is always with me. Eventually I got the strength to work on another idea during weekends and late nights. That gives you very little time, especially when you have a demanding job. It took over the course of a year to launch this new idea and it's not working out the way I hoped it would.
	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

		Call it what you want, but in my mind that's three failures in a row.
		I've learned that luck and timing are definitely part of the equation. I've learned that you can spend year after year obsessed with coding your ideas and end up with only the knowledge.
	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

		It's extremely tough and taxing to go down this route. Be prepared to fail multiple times. Be prepared to lose every cent of your savings.
	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
		I know I'll continue trying, hopefully one day I'll come back on top again :)&quot;
	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;i&gt;The product:&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
		&quot;I created a CMS that did user integration with message boards, there were few to none at the time.
		I made many mistakes, the biggest ones were:&lt;br&gt;
		1) Having hit a relatively high success at 21, I felt indestructible. I had no fear of spending most of my income on entertainment. I knew nothing about budgeting, I should have saved.&lt;br&gt;
		2) Towards the end, I definitely spent too much time having fun and ignoring the product. When you're on a high roll for so many years, you feel invincible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		The decline started gradually, but in my mind I always believed I could easily bring everything back on top. At the end, I repeatedly did everything in my power to save the product but it was too late.&quot;
	&lt;/p&gt;

Now That It’s in the Broadband Game, Google Flip-Flops on Network Neutrality
</title>
<link>
http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/07/google-neutrality/
</link>
<description>
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;entry&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In a dramatic about-face on a key internet issue yesterday, Google told the FCC that the network neutrality rules Google once championed don&amp;#x2019;t give citizens the right to run servers on their home broadband connections, and that the Google Fiber network is perfectly within its rights to prohibit customers from attaching the legal devices of their choice to its network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At issue is Google Fiber&amp;#x2019;s Terms of Service, which contains a broad prohibition against customers attaching &amp;#x201C;servers&amp;#x201D; to its ultrafast 1 Gbps network in Kansas City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google wants to ban the use of servers because it plans to offer a business class offering in the future. A potential customer, Douglas McClendon, filed a complaint against the policy in 2012 with the FCC, which eventually &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/future-participle/5a2d9322bdc4&quot;&gt;ordered Google to explain its reasoning&lt;/a&gt; by July 29.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its response, Google defended its sweeping ban by citing the very ISPs it opposed through the years-long fight for rules that require broadband providers to treat all packets equally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;Google Fiber&amp;#x2019;s server policy is consistent with policies of many major providers in the industry,&amp;#x201D; Google Fiber lawyer Darah Smith Franklin wrote, going on to quote AT&amp;amp;T, Comcast and Verizon&amp;#x2019;s anti-server policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google&amp;#x2019;s version, as it admits in its &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/Fu/F1914342/FGoogle/520Fiber/520Response/520to/520McClendon/520Complaint/520/528AS/520FILED/520072913/529.pdf&quot;&gt;response to McClendon&lt;/a&gt; (.pdf), flatly prohibits subscribers from using &amp;#x201C;any type of server:&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your Google Fiber account is for your use and the reasonable use of your guests. Unless you have a written agreement with Google Fiber permitting you do so, you should not host any type of server using your Google Fiber connection, use your Google Fiber account to provide a large number of people with Internet access, or use your Google Fiber account to provide commercial services to third parties (including, but not limited to, selling Internet access to third parties).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that a server, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/Fwiki/FServer_(computing)/3Types_of_servers&quot;&gt;by definition&lt;/a&gt;, doesn&amp;#x2019;t has to be a dedicated expensive computer. Any PC or Mac can be a server, as can all sorts of computing devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/Fedocs_public/Fattachmatch/FFCC-10-201A1.pdf&quot;&gt;net neutrality rules&lt;/a&gt; regarding devices are plain and simple:&amp;#xA0;&amp;#x201D;Fixed broadband providers may not block lawful content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Google&amp;#x2019;s legally binding Terms of Service outlaw Google Fiber customers from running their own mail server, using a remotely accessible media server, SSHing into a home computer from work to retrieve files, running a Minecraft server for friends to share, using a Nest thermometer, using a nanny camera to watch over a childcare provider or using a Raspberry Pi to host a WordPress blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of those devices would do any harm to any broadband network, let alone a Google Fiber connection with a 1Gbps capacity equally split between uploading and downloading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The server ban also prohibits you from attaching your personal computer to Google Fiber if you are using peer-to-peer software, because that works by having your computer be both a client and a server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Free Software Foundation is working on a &amp;#x201C;&lt;a href=&quot;http://freedomboxfoundation.org&quot;&gt;Freedom Box&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#x201D;&amp;#x200A;&amp;#x2014;&amp;#x200A;an open-source appliance you plug into your router that gives you ways to surf the net safely and anonymously; to help dissidents publish to the world; and to create open, distributed alternatives to Twitter and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That too, by definition, is a server and thus banned by Google Fiber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google says its rule is &amp;#x201C;fully consistent with the Open Internet Order and Rules,&amp;#x201D; citing the provisions that allow for reasonable network management. (These provisions regulate what ISPs can do when congestion happens, and are not intended to provide an excuse to ban things that might cause congestion or threaten a business model.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the Google Fiber forums, employees assure subscribers the rules aren&amp;#x2019;t meant to apply to Minecraft servers. And, in reality, Google Fiber probably won&amp;#x2019;t notice, let alone kick you off, for using a Slingbox or peer-to-peer software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call it net neutrality by the grace of cool Google employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#x2019;s not the vision of net neutrality that Google laid out in that &lt;a href=&quot;http://publicknowledge.org/Ffiles/FJoint_intervenors_open_internet_brief.pdf&quot;&gt;friend of the court brief&lt;/a&gt; (.pdf) it signed onto in November, when it argued that the FCC&amp;#x2019;s aggressive net neutrality policing made it possible for Sling to succeed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sling, a company under joint control with DISH, has also witnessed the close link between non-discriminatory online access and infrastructure investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sling is a combination of software and equipment that connects a user&amp;#x2019;s home set-top box, DVR, or DVD player to the Internet, allowing the viewing of live and recorded television from anywhere in the world&amp;#x2014;essentially &amp;#x2018;place shifting&amp;#x2019; the home television experience to wherever the user is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sling was able to overcome initial resistance by Apple and AT&amp;amp;T for inclusion in the iPad platform (Order, 25 FCC Rcd. at 17925 35 n.107), and has been available on the iPad since 2009. Overcoming this initial barrier has promoted infrastructure investment in two ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the demand for the Sling equipment has risen many times over, partly due to the product&amp;#x2019;s availability on the iPad platform. Second, the consumption of content through Sling has increased commensurately, driving further demand for access and inviting greater infrastructure investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#x2019;s D.C. tech-policy speak for: After the FCC strong-armed Apple into allowing iPhone users to connect to their Slingboxes, the public benefited with increased infrastructure investment by mobile providers and ISPs got more business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for Google Fiber&amp;#x2019;s current stance, a Slingbox is a server. A home server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in Google&amp;#x2019;s version of net neutrality, the FCC was right to force Apple to let iPhone users connect to their home servers, but the FCC has no right to force Google to let its broadband subscribers run a home server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, Google said it was important for innovation that &amp;#x201C;the main broadband gatekeepers will not act unilaterally to constrain artificially the availability of new &amp;#x2018;edge-based&amp;#x2019; content and services.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing is more edge-based than a citizen running a server on their own connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, it turns out that Google&amp;#x2019;s real net neutrality policy is that big corporate services like YouTube and Facebook shouldn&amp;#x2019;t get throttled or banned by evil ISPs like Verizon, but it&amp;#x2019;s perfectly fine for Google to control what devices citizens can use in their homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, it seems, are supposed to be good consumers of cloud services, not hosting our own Freedom Boxes, media servers, small-scale commercial services or e-mail servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#x2019;s not what net neutrality fight was about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fight was intended to make broadband services act like utilities that don&amp;#x2019;t care what a packet contains or what router, computer, phone or device you use, so long as you aren&amp;#x2019;t hurting the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the net neutrality vision of the world, broadband providers simply deliver packets as they are paid to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was just a set of online services, Google happened to fall on the side of citizens and used to advocate against broadband companies controlling the pipes. Now that it&amp;#x2019;s an ISP itself, Google&amp;#x2019;s is becoming a net neutrality hypocrite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCC has avoided addressing this issue, and in this case, simply forwarded on to Google an &amp;#x201C;informal complaint.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now that Google&amp;#x2019;s shown what it really thinks of net neutrality, the door is open for the FCC to show that it&amp;#x2019;s serious enough about the principal to take on its former corporate ally.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;

    
&lt;/div&gt;

In Lieu of Money, Toyota Donates Efficiency to New York Charity
</title>

<description>
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;article-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Food Bank for New York City is the country&amp;#x2019;s largest anti-hunger charity, feeding about 1.5 million people every year. It leans heavily, as other charities do, on the generosity of businesses, including Target, Bank of America, Delta Air Lines and the New York Yankees. Toyota was also a donor. But then Toyota had a different idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of a check, it offered kaizen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Japanese word meaning &amp;#x201C;continuous improvement,&amp;#x201D; kaizen is a main ingredient in Toyota&amp;#x2019;s business model and a key to its success, the company says. It is an effort to optimize flow and quality by constantly searching for ways to streamline and enhance performance. Put more simply, it is about thinking outside the box and making small changes to generate big results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toyota&amp;#x2019;s emphasis on efficiency proved transformative for the Food Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mobile.nytimes.com/slideshow/2013/07/26/nyregion/20130726Kaizen.html?from=nyregion&quot; class=&quot;related-asset type-slideshow&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-container &quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;btn icon icon-slideshow&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/07/26/nyregion/20130726Kaizen-slide-7H0R/20130726Kaizen-slide-7H0R-thumbLarge.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;text-container&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;asset-title&quot;&gt;Slide Show | A More Streamlined Charity&lt;/span&gt; As part of their own philanthropic efforts, Toyota is helping the Food Bank for New York City to improve its efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a soup kitchen in Harlem, Toyota&amp;#x2019;s engineers cut down the wait time for dinner to 18 minutes from as long as 90. At a food pantry on Staten Island, they reduced the time people spent filling their bags to 6 minutes from 11. And at a warehouse in Bushwick, Brooklyn, where volunteers were packing boxes of supplies for victims of Hurricane Sandy, a dose of kaizen cut the time it took to pack one box to 11 seconds from 3 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toyota has &amp;#x201C;revolutionized the way we serve our community,&amp;#x201D; said Margarette Purvis, the chief executive and president of the Food Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Toyota&amp;#x2019;s initial offer to the charity in 2011 was met with apprehension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;They make cars; I run a kitchen,&amp;#x201D; said Daryl Foriest, director of distribution at the Food Bank&amp;#x2019;s pantry and soup kitchen in Harlem. &amp;#x201C;This won&amp;#x2019;t work.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Toyota insisted it would, Mr. Foriest presented the company with a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;The line of people waiting to eat is too long,&amp;#x201D; Mr. Foriest said. &amp;#x201C;Make the line shorter.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toyota&amp;#x2019;s engineers went to work. The kitchen, which can seat 50 people, typically opened for dinner at 4 p.m., and when all the chairs were filled, a line would form outside. Mr. Foriest would wait for enough space to open up to allow 10 people in. The average wait time could be up to an hour and a half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toyota made three changes. They eliminated the 10-at-a-time system, allowing diners to flow in one by one as soon as a chair was free. Next, a waiting area was set up inside where people lined up closer to where they would pick up food trays. Finally, an employee was assigned the sole duty of spotting empty seats so they could be filled quickly. The average wait time dropped to 18 minutes and more people were fed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unusual partnership between Toyota and the Food Bank, which one Food Bank coordinator compared to a cultural exchange program, highlights a different way for-profit businesses can help their communities, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;It&amp;#x2019;s a form of corporate philanthropy but instead of giving money, they&amp;#x2019;re sharing expertise,&amp;#x201D; said David J. Vogel, a professor and an expert in corporate social responsibility at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. &amp;#x201C;It&amp;#x2019;s quite new.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And many nonprofit organizations, facing tighter budgets as financing from federal and local governments diminishes, are having to make smarter business decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;Nonprofit organizations are taking on what happens in the for-profit world because they will run better,&amp;#x201D; said Ronald P. Hill, a professor of marketing and business law at Villanova University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early 1990s, Toyota limited sharing its expertise to its auto parts suppliers. But as the Toyota Production System Support Center, the company&amp;#x2019;s headquarters of efficiency, came to recognize broader interest in the Toyota model, the company offered consulting-style services to nonautomotive manufacturers and nonprofit organizations. Today, the center supports about 40 organizations, half of which are small to midsize manufacturers that pay a small fee. The rest are nonprofits, like the Food Bank, that get the services free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;There&amp;#x2019;s a lot of opportunities in a variety of industries to improve and become more competitive by applying the Toyota production system,&amp;#x201D; said Jamie Bonini, the support center&amp;#x2019;s general manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lessons provided by Toyota come at a critical time for the Food Bank as it faces increasing demand in a weak economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;From banks to restaurants to airlines, people give money and time and we&amp;#x2019;re grateful,&amp;#x201D; Ms. Purvis said. &amp;#x201C;But, it&amp;#x2019;s very rare for people to come and say, &amp;#x2018;You know what, this is the model that made our company great and we will share it with a charity with the hope that it will provide for the neediest people in your city.&amp;#x2019; &amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Project Hospitality food pantry on Staten Island, which is part of the Food Bank network, Toyota engineers tried to expedite the pickup process. They drew a layout identifying spots where there were slowdowns. They reorganized the shelves by food groups and used colored tape to mark the grain, vegetable, fruit and protein sections. The time clients spent in the pantry was reduced nearly by half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the Food Bank called on Toyota engineers to help one of its affiliated charities, Metro World Child, keep up with demand in the Far Rockaways after Hurricane Sandy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lisa Richardson, an engineer with a background in manufacturing, watched as volunteers walked around a warehouse in Brooklyn and scrambled to pack boxes of food. So she created an assembly line and volunteers dropped food items into boxes as they moved across a conveyor belt. The average time to pack one box shrank to 11 seconds from 3 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still not satisfied, Ms. Richardson changed the size of the boxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;There was a lot of empty space in the box and they were shipping that air out in the truck,&amp;#x201D; Ms. Richardson said. The Food Bank was using standard boxes of 12 by 12 by 12 inches. By changing the size to 16 by 8 by 8, workers can pack each box more tightly and more boxes can go out in each truck&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next up, Ms. Purvis says, is a plan &amp;#x201C;to kaizen&amp;#x201D; the Food Bank&amp;#x2019;s 90,000-square-foot warehouse in the Bronx, where Toyota will try to optimize use of the space and figure out delivery routes, among other tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;I never thought that what we needed were a bunch of engineers,&amp;#x201D; Ms. Purvis said. &amp;#x201C;In our world food is king, but we didn&amp;#x2019;t know that the queen would be kaizen.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;corrections&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;correction-timestamp&quot;&gt;Correction: &lt;span class=&quot;correction-pubdate&quot;&gt;July 27, 2013&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;correction-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;An earlier version of this article misspelled the university at which the Haas School of Business is located. It is at the University of California, Berkeley, not Berkley. An earlier version also misstated the surname of a Toyota engineer. She is Lisa Richardson, not Anderson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;corrections&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;correction-timestamp&quot;&gt;Correction: &lt;span class=&quot;correction-pubdate&quot;&gt;July 31, 2013&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;correction-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;An article on Saturday about Toyota&amp;#x2019;s offering its efficiency expertise to the Food Bank for New York City misspelled the given name of the general manager of the Toyota Production System Support Center. He is Jamie Bonini, not Jaime. And because of an editing error, the article misstated the dimensions of a standard box used by the Food Bank. It is 12 by 12 by 12 inches, not 12 square inches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The U.S. government is quietly pressuring telecommunications providers to install eavesdropping technology deep inside companies' internal networks to facilitate surveillance efforts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
FBI officials have been sparring with carriers, a process that has on occasion included threats of contempt of court, in a bid to deploy government-provided software capable of intercepting and analyzing entire communications streams. The FBI's legal position during these discussions is that the software's real-time &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57521680-38/feds-snoop-on-social-network-accounts-without-warrants/&quot;&gt;interception of metadata&lt;/a&gt; is authorized under the &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57587929-38/nsa-secretly-vacuumed-up-verizon-phone-records/&quot;&gt;Patriot Act&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Attempts by the FBI to install what it internally refers to as &quot;port reader&quot; software, which have not been previously disclosed, were described to CNET in interviews over the last few weeks. One former government official said the software used to be known internally as the &quot;harvesting program.&quot;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Carriers are &quot;extra-cautious&quot; and are resisting installation of the FBI's port reader software, an industry participant in the discussions said, in part because of the privacy and security risks of unknown surveillance technology operating on an sensitive internal network.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It's &quot;an interception device by definition,&quot; said the industry participant, who spoke on condition of anonymity because court proceedings are sealed. &quot;If magistrates knew more, they would approve less.&quot; It's unclear whether any carriers have installed port readers, and at least one is actively opposing the installation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/112961607570158342254/posts/SPboVUTyhcz&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from a spokesman, the FBI said it has the legal authority to use alternate methods to collect Internet metadata, including source and destination IP addresses: &quot;In circumstances where a provider is unable to comply with a court order utilizing its own technical solution(s), law enforcement may offer to provide technical assistance to meet the obligation of the court order.&quot;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon, Comcast, and Sprint declined to comment. A government source familiar with the port reader software said it is not used on an industry-wide basis, and only in situations where carriers' own wiretap compliance technology is insufficient to provide agents with what they are seeking.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For criminal investigations, police are generally required to obtain a wiretap order from a judge to &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57593538-38/how-the-u.s-forces-net-firms-to-cooperate-on-surveillance/&quot;&gt;intercept the contents of real-time communication streams&lt;/a&gt;, including e-mail bodies, Facebook messages, or streaming video. Similar procedures exist for intelligence investigations under the &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57589672-38/snowden-nsa-snoops-on-u.s-phone-calls-without-warrants/&quot;&gt;Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act&lt;/a&gt;, which has received intense scrutiny after Edward Snowden's disclosures about the National Security Agency's &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57588337-38/no-evidence-of-nsas-direct-access-to-tech-companies/&quot;&gt;PRISM database&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There's a significant exception to both sets of laws: large quantities of metadata can be intercepted in real time through a so-called pen register and trap and trace order with minimal judicial review or oversight. That metadata includes IP addresses, e-mail addresses, identities of Facebook correspondents, Web sites visited, and possibly Internet search terms as well.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&quot;The statute hasn't caught up with the realties of electronic communication,&quot; says &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lb3law.com/attorneys.php?PeopleID=2&quot;&gt;Colleen Boothby&lt;/a&gt;, a partner at the Washington, D.C. firm of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lb3law.com/&quot;&gt;Levine, Blaszak, Block &amp;amp; Boothby&lt;/a&gt; who represents technology companies and industry associations. Judges are not always in a position, Boothby said, to understand how technology has outpaced the law.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Judges have concluded in the past that they have virtually no ability to deny pen register and trap and trace requests. &quot;The court under the Act seemingly provides nothing more than a rubber stamp,&quot; wrote a federal magistrate judge in Florida, referring to the pen register law. A federal appeals court &lt;a href=&quot;http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-8th-circuit/1301478.html&quot;&gt;has ruled&lt;/a&gt; that the &quot;judicial role in approving use of trap and trace devices is ministerial in nature.&quot;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A little-noticed section of the Patriot Act that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/20002ist/status/363060389564514304&quot;&gt;added&lt;/a&gt; one word -- &quot;process&quot; -- to existing law authorized the FBI to implant its own surveillance technology on carriers' networks. It was in part an effort to put the bureau's &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.cnet.com/Carnivore-redux/2010-1071_3-5555323.html&quot;&gt;Carnivore device&lt;/a&gt;, which also had a pen register mode, on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://judiciary.house.gov/legacy/corn0406.htm&quot;&gt;firmer legal footing&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A 2003 &lt;a href=&quot;https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;amp;crawlid=1&amp;amp;doctype=cite&amp;amp;docid=18+Berkeley+Tech.+L.J.+945&amp;amp;srctype=smi&amp;amp;srcid=3B15&amp;amp;key=0cd649948cdda01789cd1db9b9428b91&quot;&gt;compliance guide&lt;/a&gt; prepared by the U.S. Internet Service Provider Association reported that the Patriot Act's revisions permitted &quot;law enforcement agencies to use software instead of physical mechanisms to collect relevant pen register&quot; information.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even though the Patriot Act would authorize the FBI to deploy port reader software with a pen register order, the legal boundaries between permissible metadata and impermissible content remain fuzzy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&quot;Can you get things like packet size or other information that falls somewhere in the grey area between traditional pen register and content?&quot; says Alan Butler, appellate advocacy counsel at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.epic.org/&quot;&gt;Electronic Privacy Information Center&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;How does the judge know the box is actually doing? How does the service provider know? How does anyone except the technician know what's going on?&quot;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An industry source said the FBI wants providers to use their existing CALEA compliance hardware to route the targeted customer's communications through the port reader software. The software discards the content data and extracts the metadata, which is then provided to the bureau. (The 1994 &lt;a href=&quot;http://epic.org/privacy/wiretap/calea/calea_law.html&quot;&gt;Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act&lt;/a&gt;, or CALEA, requires that communication providers adopt standard practices to &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-57428067-83/fbi-we-need-wiretap-ready-web-sites-now/&quot;&gt;comply with lawful intercepts&lt;/a&gt;.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Whether the FBI believes its port reader software should be able to capture Subject: lines, URLs that can reveal search terms, Facebook &quot;likes&quot; and Google+ &quot;+1s,&quot; and so on remains ambiguous, and the bureau declined to elaborate this week. The Justice Department's 2009 manual (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.justice.gov/criminal/cybercrime/docs/ssmanual2009.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) requires &quot;prior consultation&quot; with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.justice.gov/criminal/cybercrime/&quot;&gt;Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section&lt;/a&gt; before prosecutors use a pen register to &quot;collect all or part of a URL.&quot;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The last time I had to ask anybody that, they refused to answer,&quot; says Paul Rosenzweig, a former Homeland Security official and founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redbranchconsulting.com/&quot;&gt;Red Branch Consulting&lt;/a&gt;, referring to Subject: lines. &quot;They liked creative ambiguity.&quot;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some metadata may, however, not be legally accessible through a pen register. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3127&quot;&gt;Federal law&lt;/a&gt; says law enforcement may acquire only &quot;dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information&quot; without obtaining a wiretap. That clearly covers, for instance, the Internet Protocol address of a Web site that a targeted user is visiting. The industry-created CALEA &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atis.org/docstore/product.aspx?id=22665&quot;&gt;standard&lt;/a&gt; also permits law enforcement to acquire timestamp information and other data.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But the FBI has configured its port reader to intercept all metadata -- including packet size, port label, and IPv6 flow data -- that exceeds what the law permits, according to one industry source.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In 2007, the FBI, the Justice Department, and the Drug Enforcement Administration &lt;a href=&quot;http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/view?id=6519411932&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; the Federal Communications Commission for an &quot;expedited rulemaking&quot; process to expand what wireless providers are required to do under CALEA.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The agencies said they wanted companies to be required to provide more information about Internet packets, including the &quot;field identifying the next level protocol used in the data portion of the Internet datagram,&quot; which could reveal what applications a customer is using. The FCC never ruled on the law enforcement request.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Because it's relatively easy to secure a pen register and trap and trace order -- they only require a law enforcement officer to certify the results will likely be &quot;relevant&quot; to an investigation -- they're becoming more common. The Justice Department conducted 1,661 such intercepts in 2011 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/files/pdfs/privacy/DOJ_PRTT_FOIA/DOJ0975-RIF.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;), up from only 922 a year earlier (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/files/pdfs/privacy/DOJ_PRTT_FOIA/DOJ0005-RIF.pdf&quot;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That less privacy-protective standard is no accident. A U.S. Senate report accompanying the pen register and trap and trace law said its authors did &quot;not envision an independent judicial review of whether the application meets the relevance standard.&quot; Rather, the report said, judges are only permitted to &quot;review the completeness&quot; of the paperwork.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/about/staff/hanni-fakhoury&quot;&gt;Hanni Fakhoury&lt;/a&gt;, a staff attorney at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eff.org/&quot;&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and a former federal public defender, said he's concerned about port reader software doing more than the carriers know. &quot;The bigger fear is that the boxes are secretly storing something,&quot; he said, &quot;or that they're doing more than just simply allowing traffic to sift through and pulling out the routing information.&quot;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&quot;For the Feds to try to push the envelope is to be expected,&quot; Fakhoury said. &quot;But that doesn't change the fact that we have laws in place to govern this behavior for a good reason.&quot;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

US patent office rejects claims of Apple 'pinch to zoom' patent
</title>
<link>
http://www.pcworld.com/article/2045461/us-patent-office-rejects-claims-of-apple-pinch-to-zoom-patent.html
</link>
<description>
&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;page&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has rejected claims of an Apple patent that figures prominently in a patent infringement lawsuit against Samsung Electronics, according to documents filed by the South Korean company in a U.S. federal court.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The 21 claims of the patent were rejected by the USPTO in a &quot;final office action,&quot; as they were anticipated by previous patents or unpatentable. Known as the &quot;pinch-to-zoom&quot; patent, it covers the ability to distinguish between the scrolling movement of one finger and two-fingers gestures like pinch-to-zoom on a touch-screen to activate certain functions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Apple has up to two months to respond to the USPTO decision. In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macworld.co.uk/ipad-iphone/news/?newsid=3438333&quot;&gt;a filing in April&lt;/a&gt; after USPTO rejected multiple claims of another patent in a similar final office action, Apple said it had further options, including appeal to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board and seeking judicial review.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Claim eight of the patent was involved in Apple's lawsuit against Samsung in the court, according to a filing Sunday by Samsung in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, San Jose Division. A jury last August awarded Apple US$1.05 billion in damages, but the court has ordered a partial retrial to review the damages to be paid to the iPhone maker.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;right medium&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/06/internet_gavel_keyboard-100042722-medium.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The jury found at trial that 21 of 24 Samsung smartphones and tablets infringed claim 8 of U.S. Patent No. &lt;a href=&quot;http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;d=PALL&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;s1=7,844,915.PN.&amp;amp;OS=PN/7,844,915&amp;amp;RS=PN/7,844,915&quot;&gt;7,844,915&lt;/a&gt;('915 patent), Samsung said in its filing on Sunday. The claim relates to &quot;determining whether the event object invokes a scroll or gesture operation by distinguishing between a single input point applied to the touch-sensitive display that is interpreted as the scroll operation and two or more input points applied to the touch-sensitive display that are interpreted as the gesture operation,&quot; according to a USPTO document filed in the court by Samsung.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The USPTO ruled claim eight was anticipated in U.S. Patent No. &lt;a href=&quot;http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;d=PALL&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;s1=7,724,242.PN.&amp;amp;OS=PN/7,724,242&amp;amp;RS=PN/7,724,242&quot;&gt;7,724,242&lt;/a&gt; awarded to Daniel W. Hillis and Bran Ferren. &quot;Hillis teaches distinguishing the number of contact points and determining whether the event object matches a gesture pattern,&quot; the USPTO wrote in its decision.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The USPTO rejected in April multiple claims of another patent that figured in the lawsuit, known as &quot;overscroll bounce&quot; patent. Apple, however, said in a filing that the reexamination is not finished, and it is entitled to file a response to the action which may result in a withdrawal of the rejection or certification of the claims under reexamination.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The company also raised the possibility that it may appeal to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, and if unsuccessful, may seek judicial review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. A similar filing is likely from Apple in connection with the rejection of the '915 patent, even as Samsung is expected to argue for lower damages. The jury awarded damages to Apple with regard to all but two products found to infringe the '915 patent, Samsung said in its filing.
&lt;/p&gt;

Identical Droplets in the DigitalOcean: Regenerate your Ubuntu SSH Host Keys now
</title>
<link>
http://missingm.co/2013/07/identical-droplets-in-the-digitalocean-regenerate-your-ubuntu-ssh-host-keys-now/
</link>
<description>
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;entry-content&quot;&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;When I started working on my &lt;a title=&quot;Ansible and Salt: A detailed comparison&quot; href=&quot;http://missingm.co/2013/06/ansible-and-salt-a-detailed-comparison/&quot;&gt;Ansible and Salt comparison&lt;/a&gt;, I knew that I was going to be cycling through tons of virtual machines. Micro instances at AWS are only good at making you feel sad, so I decided to give &lt;a title=&quot;DigitalOcean&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalocean.com/&quot;&gt;DigitalOcean&lt;/a&gt; a try. I had heard great things about their performance and price, and after using them for the past month and a half it&amp;#x2019;s very easy for me to understand their meteoric rise in popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the midst of testing everything, I noticed something strange. I was rapidly provisioning and destroying droplets, and most of the time the new instances were coming back on the same set of IP addresses. I soon realized that I was not being prompted to accept new host keys, nor was I ever being warned that a server&amp;#x2019;s identification had changed. So I started up five brand new Ubuntu 12.04.2 64-bit instances. I put two in San Francisco, two in New York, and one in Amsterdam just for good measure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://missingm.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ssh-host-key-flaw-1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-283&quot; alt=&quot;ssh-host-key-flaw-1&quot; src=&quot;http://missingm.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ssh-host-key-flaw-1.png&quot; width=&quot;1010&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once they were up and running, I used `ssh-keyscan` to check their host keys. This was the result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://missingm.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ssh-host-key-flaw-2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-284&quot; alt=&quot;ssh-host-key-flaw-2&quot; src=&quot;http://missingm.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ssh-host-key-flaw-2.png&quot; width=&quot;1001&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the servers had identical fingerprints. The fingerprints from another set of servers on a separate DigitalOcean account were also the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why this is a big deal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SSH host keys protect users from &lt;a title=&quot;Wikipedia: Man-in-the-middle attack&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_in_the_middle_attack&quot;&gt;man-in-the-middle attacks&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is to make it impossible for an adversary to secretly impersonate your server or intercept your traffic because they won&amp;#x2019;t be able to match your server&amp;#x2019;s unique cryptographic fingerprint. These fingerprints get cached in your known_hosts file, and if one of them changes unexpectedly then your SSH client can alert you with its infamous capitalized warning that &amp;#x201C;IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!&amp;#x201D; This allows you to tell the duplicitous barista that their cunning plan to infiltrate your machines has failed, and proudly walk away from the sketchy coffee shop in disgust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of these warnings, the protection provided by SSH is severely compromised. The OpenSSH &lt;a href=&quot;http://openssh.com/manual.html&quot; title=&quot;OpenSSH Manual Pages&quot;&gt;man pages&lt;/a&gt; state that the known_hosts file is used to &amp;#x201C;prevent server spoofing or man-in-the-middle attacks, which could otherwise be used to circumvent the encryption.&amp;#x201D; The fact that these droplets were truly identical, including their SSH host keys, meant that an attacker could easily spoof another user&amp;#x2019;s DigitalOcean server without raising any red flags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, DigitalOcean has fixed the issue and new droplets are now being created with unique host keys. If you are a DigitalOcean customer and you haven&amp;#x2019;t done so already, now would be a good time to regenerate your host keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to generate new host keys on an existing server&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, remove your old host keys:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;sudo rm -rf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, generate new host keys using ssh-keygen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;sudo ssh-keygen -A&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are using Debian or Ubuntu, you can also accomplish the same thing by reconfiguring the openssh-server package. Make sure you remove the old keys first:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;sudo dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you have run those commands, simply restart the SSH daemon so it starts up with the new keys in place:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;sudo service ssh restart&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, you&amp;#x2019;ll need to remove the server&amp;#x2019;s old keys from your local known_hosts file, otherwise you will see a warning telling you that the key has changed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;ssh-keygen -f &quot;/home/[your-username-here]/.ssh/known_hosts&quot; -R [your-server's-ip-here]&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you&amp;#x2019;re ready to connect to the server, and accept its new (unique!) host keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Timeline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 13, 2013&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Email is sent to the DigitalOcean security team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The issue is acknowledged&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some server images are updated with fixes in place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 14, 2013&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Testing reveals some cases where droplets are still being provisioned with identical keys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow-up email is sent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 20, 2013&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Further fixes are pushed, and DigitalOcean begins the process of working with existing customers to update their keys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 2, 2013&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I confirm that the previously-affected images are all correctly generating new keys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 26, 2013&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;DigitalOcean publishes their &lt;a title=&quot;Avoid Duplicate SSH Host Keys&quot; href=&quot;https://www.digitalocean.com/blog_posts/avoid-duplicate-ssh-host-keys&quot;&gt;advisory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 29, 2013&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#x2019;t had time to thoroughly explore the issue, but I suspect that this problem might affect other VPS providers as well. It would also be easy to fall into the same trap if you are using disk images to rapidly provision new hardware. Take some time to make sure that all of your servers have unique fingerprints. It&amp;#x2019;s a critical part of ensuring that your SSH traffic remains secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalocean.com/security&quot;&gt;DigitalOcean Security Team&lt;/a&gt; for their quick and responsible handling of this issue. They were very pleasant to work with throughout the entire process and I remain a happy customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve seen them. Peeking out from sidebars, jiggling and wiggling for your attention, popping up where you most expect them: those “One Weird Trick” ads. These crudely drawn Web advertisements promise easy tricks to reduce your belly fat, learn a new language, and boost your credit score by 217 points. They seem like obvious scams, but part of me has always wanted to follow the link. What, I wonder, makes the tricks so &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt;? How come only &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; trick (or sometimes &quot;tip&quot;), never more? Why are the illustrations done by small children using MS Paint? I’ve never pursued these questions, though, because a fear of computer viruses and identity theft has always stayed my hand. One curious click, I imagine, and I could wake up hogtied on an oil tanker headed to Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

                    
                     
                    &lt;div class=&quot;entry-content-asset&quot;&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; has allowed me to slake my curiosity, and yours. They gave me a loaner laptop, a prepaid debit card, and a quest: to investigate these weird tricks and report back to you. I also contacted a bevy of marketing experts to help me parse what I found. The individual tricks themselves are peculiar, but the larger trick—of why this bizarre and omnipresent marketing strategy works—tells us a lot about what makes us click, buy, and believe.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

                    
                     
                    &lt;div class=&quot;entry-content-asset&quot;&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Newly emboldened, I clicked on my first ad, which promised a cure for diabetes. Specifically, I hoped to “discover how 1 weird spice &lt;u&gt;reverses&lt;/u&gt; diabetes in 30 short days.” The ad showed a picture of cinnamon buns. Could the spice be... &lt;em&gt;cinnamon&lt;/em&gt;? Maybe I would find out. The link brought up a video with no pause button or status bar. A kindly voice began: “Prepare to be shocked.” I prepared myself. As “Lon” spoke, his words flashed simultaneously on the screen, PowerPoint-style. As soon as he started, Lon seemed fixated on convincing me to stay until the end. “This could be the most important video you ever watch,” he promised. “Watch the entire video, as the end will surprise you!”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

                        
                    
                    
                     
                    &lt;div class=&quot;entry-content-asset&quot;&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every time Lon seemed about to get to the spicy heart of the matter, he’d go off on a tangent. This video wouldn’t stay on the Internet for long, he said. The cure is for people “ready to put down the flaky answers.” Indeed, “if you’re looking for a miracle cure or new age fad, &lt;strong&gt;leave this page now.&lt;/strong&gt;” Lon also took pains to trash the medical establishment. Big Pharma has been lying to you, he said. They profit every time you take their pills, or inject yourself with their needles. But the secret spice Lon discovered can free you of the lies and the needles. You will “look and feel like you were never sick.” Your doctor will confirm your cure, astounded.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

                    
                     
                    &lt;div class=&quot;entry-content-asset&quot;&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What is Lon up to? “People tend to think something is important if it’s secret,” says Michael Norton, a marketing professor at Harvard Business School. “Studies find that we give greater credence to information if we’ve been told it was once ‘classified.’ Ads like this often purport to be the work of one man, telling you something ‘they’ don’t want you to know.” The knocks on Big Pharma not only offered a tempting needle-free fantasy; they also had a whiff of secret knowledge, bolstering the ad’s credibility.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

                    
                     
                    

                    
                     
                    &lt;div class=&quot;entry-content-asset&quot;&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s doubtful, though, that Lon has much in the way of insider info. He’s an actor hired by Barton Publishing, a firm based in South Dakota that puts out a wide variety of crankish health literature—there’s nary a foodstuff that isn’t the cure to some ailment in one of Barton’s booklets. Most “one weird trick” ads are hard to trace back to a specific marketing firm with flesh-and-blood employees, but Barton is open about the kind of publishing it does, with pictures and bios of their contributors &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bartonpublishing.com&quot; class=&quot;entry-content-asset&quot;&gt;on its website&lt;/a&gt;. (Notably, the first person listed is not a homeopath but a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;entry-content-asset&quot;&gt;“split tester.”&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

                    
                     
                    &lt;div class=&quot;entry-content-asset&quot;&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Barton brain trust seemed surprisingly sincere, which I kept in mind as I turned to my next ad. I clicked to learn “the REAL reason why Obama is trying to take your guns away.” You’d think health quackery and gun paranoia would have little in common, but soon I was brought to a page with a self-playing, pauseless video and a male voice urging me to watch to the end. Apparently Obama has signed an executive order authorizing him to institute martial law and “steal your food supply,” but “Matt” has developed “a weird but incredibly effective system” to survive the coming storm.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

                    
                     
                    &lt;div class=&quot;entry-content-asset&quot;&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the interests of journalism, I also checked out the “1 Weird Secret That Pornstars Use to Get BIG DICKS.” Sure enough, this involved a dude talking at me while words flashed on the screen: “Stay until the end of this video... it will &lt;strong&gt;shock you&lt;/strong&gt;.” But before he spilled the beans on “what’s holding you back from the big penis you deserve,” he needed to regale me with tales of his buddy Kyle, who added 2 inches and improved his confidence with the ladies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

                    
                     
                    

                    &lt;a name=&quot;pagebreak_anchor_2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
                    
                    
                     
                    &lt;div class=&quot;entry-content-asset&quot;&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What really puzzled me about this formula—as I sat through video after video, alternately bored and enraged—is that there’s no way to shut the guy up and just buy the dick pills already. The videos were all 15 to 30 minutes long, and you had to sit through the whole thing before you can hand over your credit card. I’d thought the point of all this teasing was to inspire impatience—provoking customers to pay up to end the suspense. I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

                    
                     
                    &lt;div class=&quot;entry-content-asset&quot;&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Research on persuasion shows the more arguments you list in favor of something, regardless of the quality of those arguments, the more that people tend to believe it,” Norton says. “Mainstream ads sometimes use long lists of bullet points—people don’t read them, but it’s persuasive to know there are so many reasons to buy.” OK, but if more is better, then why only &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; trick? “People want a simple solution that has a ton of support.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

                    
                     
                    &lt;div class=&quot;entry-content-asset&quot;&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What about all the weirdness? “A word like ‘weird’ is not so negative, and kind of intriguing,” says Oleg Urminsky of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. “There’s this foot-in-the-door model. If you lead with a strong, unbelievable claim it may turn people off. But if you start with ‘isn’t this kind of weird?’ it lowers the stakes.” The model also explains why some ads ask you to click on your age first. “Giving your age is low-stakes but it begins the dialogue. The hard sell comes later.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

                    
                     
                    &lt;div class=&quot;entry-content-asset&quot;&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Poorly drawn graphics are a deliberate choice as well. “People notice when you put something in the space that’s different, even if it’s ugly,” Urminsky says. “This might hurt the brand of established companies, but the companies here have non-existent or negative brand associations, so it may be worth it for the extra attention.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

                    
                     
                    &lt;div class=&quot;entry-content-asset&quot;&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Plus, “if the ad were too professional, it might undermine the illusion that it’s one man against the system,” Norton says. Slick ads suggest profit-hungry companies, not stay-at-home moms or rogue truth-tellers trying to help the little guy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

                    
                     
                    &lt;div class=&quot;entry-content-asset&quot;&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There may be another reason for the length and shoddiness of the ads. “The point is not always to get the customer to buy the product,” Urminsky says. “It may be to vet the customer. Long videos can act as a sorting mechanism, a way to ‘qualify your prospects.’ Once you’ve established this is a person who’ll sit through anything, you can contact them by email later and sell them other products.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

                    
                     
                    &lt;div class=&quot;entry-content-asset&quot;&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Those Nigerian prince scams are not very convincing,” he adds, “but they’re meant not to be. If you’re a skeptical person, the scammers want to spend as little time with you as possible. These videos may screen people in a similar way.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

                    
                     
                    &lt;div class=&quot;entry-content-asset&quot;&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though “one weird trick” ads may not be aimed at the average consumer, they show how deftly marketers have learned to manipulate our beliefs. There may be little daylight between the temptation of learning a weird trick at the behest of a sketchy mail-order outfit and the provocative headlines of mainstream news outlets like &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt;, or—indeed!—&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The science of grabbing and directing your attention advances each time you click a link on your Facebook feed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

                    
                     
                    &lt;div class=&quot;entry-content-asset&quot;&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Arguably, &lt;em&gt;this very article&lt;/em&gt; has behaved like a one-weird-trick ad in delaying gratification this long. So what &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; happen when you grit your teeth and watch to the end of the videos? Well, your dick gets bigger with MaleFormulaXL, an herbal blend that runs you $89.95 per auto-renewed bottle. You can survive the Obama-calypse with a booklet on bunker-building and water purification. Eliminate belly fat using the thoroughly disproven extracts of garcinia cambogia and acai. And diabetes—just add cinnamon. The weirdest trick of all, of course, was getting anyone to click in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

                    
                     
                    



&lt;/div&gt;

Introducing Quip
</title>
<link>
https://quip.com/blog/introducing-quip
</link>
<description>
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we are extremely excited to launch&amp;#xA0;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quip.com/&quot;&gt;Quip&lt;/a&gt;. Quip is a modern word processor that enables you to create beautiful documents on any device &amp;#x2014; phones, tablets and the desktop. If you haven't already, &lt;a href=&quot;http://quip.mobi/&quot;&gt;download Quip&lt;/a&gt; to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://d26wz3l5q5ywv2.cloudfront.net/eoKrvf-eGjU8NIFX6hlWFA&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d26wz3l5q5ywv2.cloudfront.net/gtolBodzUgpOHoJjqRhZeQ&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why Quip?&amp;#xA0;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the iPhone was introduced in 2007, phones and tablets have transformed the way we interact with technology and each other. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2408515&quot;&gt;Smartphone sales have already overtaken PC sales&lt;/a&gt;, and&amp;#xA0;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS24129713&quot;&gt;tablet sales are predicted to pass PCs this year&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on where you live, this shift may have already happened &amp;#x2014; when you walk into an airport anywhere around the Bay Area, there is barely a laptop in sight amidst a sea of iPads and phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To call this shift disruptive is understating its impact on our industry and the world. Companies built on the PC ecosystem are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/17/business/dells-earnings-fall-79-as-sales-of-pcs-fade.html&quot;&gt;desperately&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/technology/personaltech/microsoft-office-for-the-iphone-is-here-yawn.html?pagewanted=all&quot;&gt;trying&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#xA0;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_23680121/intel-earnings-meet-expectations-but-company-warns-pc&quot;&gt;to find&lt;/a&gt; an identity in this new world, and many of them won't succeed. Most people in the developing world  will access the Internet for the first time through a mobile, touch-screen device without ever touching a PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the magnitude of this shift, the software that we use to get work done has not evolved over the past thirty years. Here's one of the first graphical word processors ever created, MacWrite, released with the original Macintosh in 1984:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://d26wz3l5q5ywv2.cloudfront.net/rX2WgDekrBbczZVxk7MV8g&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d26wz3l5q5ywv2.cloudfront.net/rX2WgDekrBbczZVxk7MV8g&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the exception of some additional color and and a stack of toolbars at the top of the screen, it doesn't look different from the software that probably came bundled with your current laptop. We still use the same metaphors and the same workflow that&amp;#xA0;we used when&amp;#xA0;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.liketotally80s.com/top-80s-fashion-trends.html&quot;&gt;shoulder pads and leg warmers&lt;/a&gt; were cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The features these products have accrued over thirty years have made it difficult for most of us to switch to new products, but they have also made it almost impossible for the products to truly change. When we decided to build Quip, it was based on the premise that the shift to tablets and phones is so fundamental and so all-encompassing that it dwarfs the sum of all of these features in importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quip is our perspective on how modern, mobile documents should work. We've re-thought everything &amp;#x2014; from the user interface to the underlying technology &amp;#x2014; to create the product that we want to use to get work done every day. Our entire company already runs on it. We hope you'll love it as much as we do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What Quip does differently&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We designed Quip with four core design goals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaboration&lt;/strong&gt; - When you write a document, you almost always want to share with someone else. Quip  combines documents and messages into a single chat-like &amp;#x201C;thread&amp;#x201D; of updates. You can all edit the same document &amp;#x2014; no matter what device you're on &amp;#x2014; and don't have to bounce back and forth to email to talk about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobility&lt;/strong&gt; - Quip works on the desktop, but it really shines on phones and tablets. Quip documents automatically format to the size of your screen &amp;#x2014; no more pinch zooming just to read a document! The product also works perfectly offline, syncing whenever you have an internet connection. Whether you're writing a document on an airplane or on the subway with a spotty internet connection, Quip just works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interactivity&lt;/strong&gt; - You can print Quip documents, but nowadays we tend to read on touch-screens rather than printing. That's why Quip documents aren't just typeset words on a page &amp;#x2014; they're truly interactive. You can turn a bulleted list into a checklist, transforming your meeting notes into a shared task list. You can @mention other documents to link between them. You can create a table of sales data, and your entire team can type data into the table at the same time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simplicity&lt;/strong&gt; - Back in the early days of GUI development, there was a popular saying: &amp;#x201C;Easy is hard.&amp;#x201D; When designing a user interface, it's much harder to remove something than to add in something new. We've worked hard to simplify the Quip interface, to leave you with a minimal, elegant design that helps you focus on writing &amp;#x2014; not ribbons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Desktop&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://d26wz3l5q5ywv2.cloudfront.net/eoKrvf-eGjU8NIFX6hlWFA&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d26wz3l5q5ywv2.cloudfront.net/gtolBodzUgpOHoJjqRhZeQ&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Desktop is your home screen in Quip. On the left, you can see the Inbox. The Inbox represents everything that has been shared with you: all your new documents and messages with the most recent updates at the top. On the right, you can see the Desktop, which lets you arrange and access &amp;#x201C;your stuff&amp;#x201D;: the folders and documents that you are currently working on. In both views, the unread state (a blue dot) helps you keep track of what things you haven't seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A Quip Document&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://d26wz3l5q5ywv2.cloudfront.net/jtQBkzBAkzVr7NTLHgVUmg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d26wz3l5q5ywv2.cloudfront.net/sZOM2WzryZ-u-Qu5OLSVlg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quip combines documents and messages into a single &amp;#x201C;thread.&amp;#x201D; In the screenshot above, the conversation is on the left, and the document is on the right. The conversation includes all the activity in the document: messages, document edits, and who's viewed your changes &amp;#x2014; everything that's happened since the document was created. Staying up to date is easy: just open the thread on any device, and you can quickly see the messages and edits since you've last visited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Document edits, or &amp;#x201C;diffs,&amp;#x201D; are one of the more unique features of Quip. Every time an edit is made to a document, a diff is added to the thread, which succinctly and visually tells you exactly what has been changed. When you're working with others or checking in from your phone, diffs make it easy to stay up to date, without re-reading the whole document.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Shared Folders&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;no-resize&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://d26wz3l5q5ywv2.cloudfront.net/aSdzDa_ztszfTn21IMEyKQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d26wz3l5q5ywv2.cloudfront.net/z_sxEaubStMJ4rBpBM1Yqg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shared folders enable you to share recipes with your family or organize a project at work. Everyone in the folder gets notified when new documents are added, and the whole group can jump in and edit or discuss changes in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the arrangement of the documents on the screen is shared &amp;#x2014; one organized person on your team can keep stuff in order for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Instant communication&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://d26wz3l5q5ywv2.cloudfront.net/MUpVR__QVSbHSTk4kek3tw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://d26wz3l5q5ywv2.cloudfront.net/VVI8htrqZM3x1oX0q0vChw&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Quip, your phone, tablet, and desktop all work together so that communication and collaboration happens instantly in a light-weight way. You get a push notification whenever there's activity in one of your documents. That means you'll get a notification if someone adds something new to the grocery list when you're at the grocery store, and you can respond while you're shopping. Likewise, when you send your boss a proposal, you'll get a notification when she opens it for the first time, and you can jump in to interactively walk her through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Using Quip&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quip is available today. To create an account on your iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch, &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/app/quip/id647922896&quot;&gt;install the app&lt;/a&gt;. To create an account on your desktop, visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://quip.com/&quot;&gt;https://quip.com/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have an Android app in the works. If you already have a Quip account and are willing to tolerate a few quirks, you can download the Quip&amp;#xA0;&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quip.quip&quot;&gt;Android Preview Release&lt;/a&gt; today in the Google Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quip is free for personal use and a subscription-based service for businesses. If you want to try Quip at your business, just install the app &amp;#x2014; it's free to try, and that's the best way to decide whether the product works well for your team. For more details on pricing, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://quip.com/business/&quot;&gt;Quip Business&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Our mission&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we started this company, our goal was to create products for work that you actually enjoy using every day. We think it's a shame that the apps we use at work are old, poorly designed, and bear the legacy of thirty years of feature creep and clutter. We think your time at work should be composed of the same delightful, beautiful experiences you've come to expect from modern mobile apps. We are starting with the word processor, but our mission is to eventually build the productivity suite for the mobile era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope you enjoy using Quip as much as we enjoyed creating it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2014;Bret &amp;amp; Kevin&lt;/p&gt;

The Door To The FISA Court Doesn't Even Have A Sign On It

&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody will actually tell you where the door to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Foreign_Intelligence_Surveillance_Court&quot;&gt;Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#x2014; also known as the &quot;FISA Court&quot; &amp;#x2014; is. It's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/secret-court-judges-upset-at-portrayal-of-collaboration-with-government/2013/06/29/ed73fb68-e01b-11e2-b94a-452948b95ca8_story.html&quot;&gt;understood&lt;/a&gt; to have moved from the Department of Justice to the E. Barrett Prettyman Courthouse in 2009, but when I visited Prettyman, the employees in the first floor District Clerk's office (gently) laughed at my attempts to find anything about the Court. They referred to it as the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Room_of_Requirement&quot;&gt;Room of Requirement&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, and said they had no idea what floor it was even on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you walk through each floor of the Courthouse, and if you believe the Washington Post's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/01/AR2009030101730.html&quot;&gt;2009 description&lt;/a&gt; of the FISA Court door as having &quot;biometric hand scanners&quot; and being in a &quot;public hallway&quot;, then it becomes pretty obvious that on the 3rd floor's solemn hallway, you've found your door:&lt;/p&gt;

Unless you're staff or a juror, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/home.nsf/Content/VL+-+Courthouse+-+Cell+Phones+Laptops+and+Other+Electronic+Devices&quot;&gt;no recording devices allowed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;small class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
          &lt;span&gt;Pro tip: the nicer you dress, the less likely they are to ask you about your business there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt; Your laptop and phone will get put in a little metal locker along with your photo ID, and you'll be given a key to get them on the way out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the right of the door, next to the intercom and the small sign saying &quot;Access Restricted&quot;, is a biometric hand scanner. It's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.amgtime.com/hardware/AMG-HandPunch-3000E&quot;&gt;Schlage HandPunch&lt;/a&gt;, a device that quickly snapshots the three-dimensional bone and joint structure of the hand and matches it against previously registered snapshots.&lt;/p&gt;

The dial appears to be disabled during business hours; the glass window was blank, and an employee who entered the door while I was there simply scanned her hand and opened the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several people I've described this to felt certain these protections were to meet the requirements of a &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitive_Compartmented_Information_Facility&quot;&gt;SCIF&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, the government's formal name for a room qualified to store classified information. Building a SCIF is complicated and expensive &amp;#x2014; the office of the Director of National Intelligence published a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.insulationstop.com/resources/Director_Signature_Technical_Specifications_Construction_Management_Sensitive_Compartmented_Information_Facilities.pdf&quot;&gt;156 page technical compliance manual&lt;/a&gt;. That &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/01/AR2009030101730.html&quot;&gt;Washington Post piece&lt;/a&gt; cites the FISA Court's new digs as a $2 million investment, an expense justified by the Court's ex-chief Judge Royce C. Lamberth as a way for the Court to get out of the belly of the Department of Justice and look its proper part as the judicial branch's independent enforcer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/secret-court-judges-upset-at-portrayal-of-collaboration-with-government/2013/06/29/ed73fb68-e01b-11e2-b94a-452948b95ca8_story.html&quot;&gt;how fervently&lt;/a&gt; the Court wants to be seen as in service of the public and not the executive, it's absurd that the FISA Court's door should stand nameless and undocumented in a public hallway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of that, there's no obvious way for the public to interact with even the Court's unclassified work. I visited Prettyman not just to gawk at the door, but to find paper versions of the documents the FISA Court has been filing at its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/courts/fisc/index.html&quot;&gt;official public docket&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;small class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
          &lt;span&gt;I've been &lt;a href=&quot;http://konklone.com/post/following-the-fisa-court-the-advanced-internet-way&quot;&gt;tracking this docket&lt;/a&gt; over at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FISACourt&quot;&gt;@FISACourt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt; The Court invented their public docket on the fly back in June, and I'm very glad it exists, but from a public records standpoint, it's a mess. The Court publishes scanned image PDFs that are impossible to search through electronically. Some PDFs show up in multiple dockets, their publication times are only discernible from a clerk's physical stamp, and the links are unpredictable. It's not even clear whether the links or the site itself are permanent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/courts/fisc/misc-13-02-04-brief-of-amici-curiae-130715.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://konklone.com/assets/images/fisa/fisa-docket.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet these ad hoc PDFs are the only public records we have from the Court. There's no Clerk's office to be found, and there is no e-mail address: only a phone number buried in the middle of a PDF of the FISC's official &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/rules/FISC2010.pdf&quot;&gt;Rules of Procedure&lt;/a&gt;. If you call it, you'll get a terse voicemail message thanking you for calling the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, and a beep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should you want to actually &lt;strong&gt;use&lt;/strong&gt; the FISA Court by filing a motion of some kind, the wall between the Court and the executive quickly becomes paper thin. Activist Jonathan Corbett &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mynsarecords.com/blog/2013-06-17-want-to-file-a-motion-in-the-fisa-court/&quot;&gt;wrote about&lt;/a&gt; how he left a message at the Court's number, and got a call back not from Court staff, but an employee from the Department of Justice. Others who have been involved with actually submitting filings in the Court's current public dockets have told me the same thing: they have to interact with the FISA Court &lt;strong&gt;through&lt;/strong&gt; the Department of Justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is supposed to be an actual Court, functioning in the service of the public and the Constitution as an independent overseer of the executive branch, where is its public face? Where are its unclassified records? Why can't we talk to its Clerk?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if nothing else: why won't it put its name on its door?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Why does Angular.js rock?
</title>
<link>
http://angular-tips.com/blog/2013/08/why-does-angular-dot-js-rock/
</link>
<description>
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;entry-content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#x2019;s see if we can discover why :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angular.js is a MV* (Model &amp;#x2013; View &amp;#x2013; Whatever) Javascript framework which is maintained by Google which excels in the creation of &lt;code&gt;single-page-applications&lt;/code&gt; or even for adding some &amp;#x201C;magic&amp;#x201D; to our classic web applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could spend all the day writing sentences of why you should try Angular.js in your new project, but I feel it that would be better if we see it in action.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;Data binding and scopes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first question that usually comes to mind is: Does it support data binding?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#x2019;s see an example of Angular.js&amp;#x2019; way of data binding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;index.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Insert your name:&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-model=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;user.name&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Echo: {{user.name}}&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In this little piece of code, there are a few things to explain but before that, I want you to get familiarized with the code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Try it&lt;/h2&gt;


  &lt;span&gt;Insert your name:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;Echo: {{user.name}}&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: Don&amp;#x2019;t worry too much about the &lt;code&gt;ng-app&lt;/code&gt; thing at this moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you see, what we write in the input, is echoed after it. But how? In plain words, we can make a two-way binding in the input thanks to the &lt;code&gt;ng-model&lt;/code&gt; directive (more on directives later in the article).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, but where are we saving that &lt;code&gt;user.name&lt;/code&gt;? In our &lt;code&gt;$scope&lt;/code&gt;. Every time we type something in our input, our &lt;code&gt;user.name&lt;/code&gt; object in the scope is going to be updated. Then we can output our models thanks to Angular.js interpolation &lt;span&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{ ... }}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. With this we can show the value of &lt;code&gt;user.name&lt;/code&gt; in our HTML. With this, when we type a letter in the input, our &lt;code&gt;user.name&lt;/code&gt; is saved into the scope and then we can see it in the HTML thanks to the interpolation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright alright, that wasn&amp;#x2019;t hard, but&amp;#x2026;. What is that &lt;code&gt;$scope&lt;/code&gt; thing you&amp;#x2019;re talking about? The &lt;code&gt;$scope&lt;/code&gt; is basically the glue between our controllers and our templates. It is an object where we can put our models so we can achieve two-way data binding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://angular-tips.com/images/angularrocks/diag1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that we set &lt;code&gt;user.name&lt;/code&gt; into our &lt;code&gt;$scope&lt;/code&gt; from the template, so we can access it from our controller too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#x2019;s see a complex example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;app.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;angular&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'app'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;controller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'MainCtrl'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'World'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;index.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-app=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-controller=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;MainCtrl&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  Hello, {{ message }}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;See it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello, World&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing we are doing here is defining our Angular application. To do that we just create an angular module which receives a name and an array of dependencies (Line 1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our &lt;code&gt;app&lt;/code&gt; in place the next thing to do is to create our controller. We do this calling the &lt;code&gt;controller&lt;/code&gt; method in our &lt;code&gt;app module&lt;/code&gt;. We give it a name and a function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The function receives the &lt;code&gt;$scope&lt;/code&gt; (More on this later) that we are going to use for our two-way data binding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we attach a string &lt;code&gt;message&lt;/code&gt; in our &lt;code&gt;$scope&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our view you will notice that our &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; tags have things in it. What are those? They are &lt;code&gt;directives&lt;/code&gt;, they teach new tricks to our html, and in this case, we are using two of them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ng-app&lt;/code&gt; tells angular that the body element contains our Angular application, that means that everything inside it will be treated by Angular. Normally you would use it in the &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; tags and from now on, I won&amp;#x2019;t show it anymore. The parameter is the name of our app, so it matches the name we gave to it in the module.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ng-controller&lt;/code&gt;: with this directive, we assign as our element&amp;#x2019;s scope that controller. In this case &lt;code&gt;MainCtrl&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then we just interpolate our message in the template :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be represented visually like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://angular-tips.com/images/angularrocks/diag2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because you&amp;#x2019;re so smart, I know you have a question: Can&amp;#x2019;t we bind functions to our &lt;code&gt;$scope&lt;/code&gt; ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;app.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;index.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-controller=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;MainCtrl&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  What's is your name?:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-model=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;user.name&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-click=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;greet()&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Click here!&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{{ message }}&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Try it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  What&amp;#x2019;s is your name?:
  
  &lt;h3&gt;{{ message }}&lt;/h3&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If we look into the controller, we can see how we attached to the &lt;code&gt;$scope&lt;/code&gt; a function. That function will attach a message to the &lt;code&gt;$scope&lt;/code&gt; as the result of a concatenation of a string and the content that was binded to our input &lt;code&gt;$scope.user.name&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in the HTML we created a button and we used &lt;code&gt;ng-click&lt;/code&gt; directive. In short this directive makes the element clickable so upon a click it will execute the function that we assigned to it &lt;code&gt;greet()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: You will notice that pressing &lt;code&gt;enter&lt;/code&gt; in the input doesn&amp;#x2019;t work. That is normal, I wanted to show how &lt;code&gt;ng-click&lt;/code&gt; works :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://angular-tips.com/images/angularrocks/diag3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Directives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what are these directives about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A directive is a way of teaching HTML new tricks. HTML is really powerful but sometimes we need more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you think&amp;#x2026; Is that really needed? See yourself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;jquery_index.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;chart&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is this code doing? Prff I don&amp;#x2019;t have a clue, I see an id there, but who knows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we look in one of our 30 javascript files and we saw:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;charts.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'#chart'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pieChart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aha! So it is the container of a pie chart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#x2019;s the problem? You can&amp;#x2019;t figure out what your page does if you don&amp;#x2019;t look at every javacript file that is attached to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then look at this code of an Angular app:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;angular_index.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;pie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;-chart&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;width=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;400&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;height=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;400&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;data=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;data&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;/pie-chart&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;#x2019;t this more clear? With a simple look we know that we are adding a pie chart, and not only that, we can see how big it is and what data it has assigned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a curiosity, you can check a example &lt;code&gt;pie-chart&lt;/code&gt; I did for fun &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/7vK8v2Om0N&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Built-in directives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angular comes with a lot of built-in directives, let&amp;#x2019;s analyze some of them, but we already saw &lt;code&gt;ng-app&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ng-controller&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ng-click&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ng-model&lt;/code&gt; (You see the pattern here, &lt;code&gt;ng&lt;/code&gt; is a diminutive of Angular).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine that we have a portion of our page that we want to show only if a certain property is true:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-click=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;show = !show&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Show&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-show=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;show&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;   I am only visible when show is true.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Try it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
   I am only visible when show is true.
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;code&gt;ng-show&lt;/code&gt; we show the element (and childs) only if the expression, in our case the value of the binding, is true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note how we used &lt;code&gt;ng-click&lt;/code&gt; this time. There is no need of create a function in our controller (we don&amp;#x2019;t even have a controller this time!), we can write an expression as the directive&amp;#x2019;s argument and in this case, we toggle the value of &lt;code&gt;show&lt;/code&gt;. Which starts &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; and is set to true with the first click.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have &lt;code&gt;ng-hide&lt;/code&gt; which does the opposite :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#x2019;s go to something funnier. What if we have an array of objects and we want to list it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;app.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;angular&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;module&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'app'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;controller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'MainCtrl'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;developers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Jesus&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;country&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Spain&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Dave&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;country&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Canada&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Wesley&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;country&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;USA&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;index.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-app=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;app&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-controller=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;MainCtrl&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;   &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-repeat=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;person in developers&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;     {{person.name}} from {{person.country}}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;   &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;See it&lt;/h2&gt;


 &lt;p&gt;
   from 
 &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: In the &lt;code&gt;See it&lt;/code&gt; I had to modify the code because it is really tricky to add interactivity to the articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, we define a list of objects in our controller, nothing that would surprise you and then we use the &lt;code&gt;ng-repeat&lt;/code&gt; directive in our HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does it work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ng-repeat&lt;/code&gt; will create a new template for every item in the collection. So in our case and since we have 4 items in it, it will create this piece of code four times:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-repeat=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;person in developers&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt; {{person.name}} from {{person.country}}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Every copy will contain its &lt;strong&gt;own scope&lt;/strong&gt;. So now in this template we don&amp;#x2019;t have the controller as the scope, in this case, the person is the scope. This means that we don&amp;#x2019;t have access to our parent controller from here (This isn&amp;#x2019;t totally true, there are ways to access it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me show it visually:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://angular-tips.com/images/angularrocks/diag4.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much better :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Can we create our own directives?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you expect? Of course we can!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can create almost anything. Directives for modal dialogs, accordions, paginators, charts, search form&amp;#x2026;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are they always that visual? No, you can create directives that won&amp;#x2019;t do anything visual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#x2019;s begin with an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going back to our greet example, we had this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;form.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-controller=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;MainCtrl&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  What's is your name?:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-model=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;user.name&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-click=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;greet()&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Click here!&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{{ message }}&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It works great but what if we want the input to have the focus when the page loads? jQuery right? We grab the input and we call the &lt;code&gt;focus()&lt;/code&gt; method in it. &lt;strong&gt;NO&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With directives we wan&amp;#x2019;t our HTML to be as self-descriptive as possible so we are going to create a &lt;code&gt;focus&lt;/code&gt; directive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;focus.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;directive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'focus'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;attrs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;focus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we are calling the &lt;em&gt;directive&lt;/em&gt; function of our &lt;em&gt;app&lt;/em&gt; object, this like our controller receives the name of the directive and a function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Directives is the most complex thing in the entire Angular.js and for the sake of simplicity (this is like a showcase article :P) I won&amp;#x2019;t give excesive details (but I promise several articles on the subject in a future).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A directive needs to return an object and there we can define some attributes in it, in our case, none. A directive can also return a link function. Is in the link function where we put most of our template logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can register DOM listeners here, update our DOM, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The link function receives 3 parameters (Actually 4, but that is more advanced), the &lt;code&gt;scope&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;element&lt;/code&gt; itself and its attributes &lt;code&gt;attr&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we can bind our element to &lt;code&gt;click&lt;/code&gt; event or &lt;code&gt;mouseenter&lt;/code&gt; among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our case we grab the first element (our input) and call the &lt;code&gt;focus&lt;/code&gt; function in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#x2019;re wondering how can we work with the element, check the official doc: &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.angularjs.org/api/angular.element&quot;&gt;Element API&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple as that. The only thing needed now is to use it. Just put the directive name in the element you want to grab your focus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;form.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-controller=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;MainCtrl&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  What's is your name?:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;focus&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-model=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;user.name&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-click=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;greet()&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Click here!&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{{ message }}&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;: There is no &lt;code&gt;Try it&lt;/code&gt; this time, seems like octopress is grabbing the focus too and my example won&amp;#x2019;t work here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fair enough, this directive was really simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about a directive that will render some HTML?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;hello.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;directive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'hello'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;restrict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;E&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Hello readers, thank you for coming&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one returns the object and in there we set some attributes (as we said earlier).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;restrict: A directive can be placed in several places:

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;ttribute, like: &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div foo&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;lement, like: &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;foo&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/foo&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;lass, like: &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div class=&quot;foo&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Co&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;ment, like: &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!-- directive: foo --&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;replace: If we set this to true, our element will be replaced with our new template&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;template: Here we put the template we want to append (or replace as we have seen) into the element.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are restricting our directive to element (is restricted to attribute by default) and we specifying a template to replace our element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot more options that we can use in our directives, but these will do the work we need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that we are not using a link function here, that is because we need no logic here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to use it? Easy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;index.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;See it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello readers, thank you for coming&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you inspect the code, you will see that the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;hello&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/hello&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; as been replaced for &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Hello readers, thank you for coming&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; as we expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Filters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine that we have a view where we show a shopping basket:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;There are 13 phones in the basket. Total: {{ 1232.12 }}&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;See it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 13 phones in the basket. Total: 1232.12&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice how can we use some basic expressions in the interpolation. In this case we are printing a number. We can read it and realize that we are talking about $1,232.12 but wouldn&amp;#x2019;t be better if we can convert that number into money?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, and that is really easy with filters. There is an example of the &lt;code&gt;currency&lt;/code&gt; filter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;There are 13 phones in the basket. Total: {{ 1232.12 | currency }}&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;See it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 13 phones in the basket. Total: $1,232.12&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much better, isn&amp;#x2019;t it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, we can use a filter using the &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; character. Is like we do in a Unix environment, piping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can pipe one or more filters in a expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, we can specify an order in a &lt;code&gt;ng-repeat&lt;/code&gt;. Let&amp;#x2019;s try it out with the developers collection we made earlier:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-repeat=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;person in developers | orderBy:'name'&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    {{ person.name }} from {{ person.country }}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;See it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see here something interesting. We can pass parameters to the filters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;orderBy&lt;/code&gt; filters receives a predicate which will use to order. In our case we passed &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; so we will order the list by name. Note that if we put &lt;code&gt;-name&lt;/code&gt; as the predicate, we will order ir in reverse mode :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you are thinking at this moment&amp;#x2026; Not bad, they can be useful&amp;#x2026;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, this next one will blow your mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine that we don&amp;#x2019;t have 4 developers, we have 300 and we want to filter them (by name, country&amp;#x2026;). So you starts planning how to filter your collections, swap the non-filtered one with the filtered&amp;#x2026;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is a way more simple (Again using the same controller as before with the list of developers):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-controller=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;MainCtrl&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  Search: &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-model=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;search&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;   &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;     &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-repeat=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;person in developers | filter:search&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;       {{ person.name }} from {{ person.country }}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;     &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;   &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Try it&lt;/h2&gt;


 Search: &lt;p&gt;
   from 
 &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Wow! That is awesome. We only needed a filter!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt; filter, you only need to pass a parameter which will contain the filter itself. In this case, we pass &lt;code&gt;search&lt;/code&gt; which is binded to our scope and it is populated by our input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want, you can make the filter more precisely, you can do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-controller=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;MainCtrl&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  Search: &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-model=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;search.name&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;   &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;     &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-repeat=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;person in developers | filter:search&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;       {{ person.name }} from {{ person.country }}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;     &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;   &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With this (notice how we are binding to &lt;code&gt;search.name&lt;/code&gt; in the input) we are now filtering just by name. The filter parameter doesn&amp;#x2019;t change. It is binded to the &lt;code&gt;search&lt;/code&gt; object and it will find there a name populated with by our input and then filter by name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you&amp;#x2019;re excited with this too :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about creating our own filter? Yeah!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A filter to capitalize the text. How? Like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;capitalize.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'capitalize'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;param&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;substring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toUpperCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;substring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A filter returns a function which receives the input (the result of the interpolation) and the filter parameter. The function returns our new input. In this case it capitalize the input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, we just need to use it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{{ &quot;this is some text&quot; | capitalize }}&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;See it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is some text&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had to wrap our string into quotes to make it a literal string. Then we &amp;#x201C;pipe&amp;#x201D; our capitalize filter and it works!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Services&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And our last section for this article, services. What is a service? They are singleton classes that provides certain functionality to our app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of splitting our app logic into the controllers, we can put that logic into different services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angular has a lot of built-in services, managing &lt;code&gt;$http&lt;/code&gt; requests, &lt;code&gt;$q&lt;/code&gt; for promises, etc. But in this part we are not going to talk about any built-in service, because they are more complex to explain and that belongs to a new article. Instead we are going to create a simple one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the more common uses for a service is to share information along controllers. Every controller has its own scope so you can&amp;#x2019;t bind to other controller scope. The solution is to use services, so you can have the data in one central place and then use it where you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let&amp;#x2019;s try this without the service to see the problem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;index.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-controller=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;MainCtrl&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  MainCtrl:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-model=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;user.name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-controller=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;SecondCtrl&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  SecondCtrl:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;text&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ng-model=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;user.name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;figure class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;controllers.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Try it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, since you have your inputs binded to the same model, you expect that writing in a box, will update the other one. Like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://angular-tips.com/images/angularrocks/diag5.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is not true, what is really happening is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://angular-tips.com/images/angularrocks/diag6.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we are going to fix this with a service which will hold the user name so we can use it in both controllers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;user_information.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;factory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'UserInformation'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Angular.js&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used the &lt;code&gt;factory&lt;/code&gt; function of our app module to create a service. There are other advanced ways to create services (using the &lt;code&gt;service&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;provider&lt;/code&gt; functions, but that belongs to another post).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several ways to create a service, we are creating a private &lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt; object with a predefined name and then we are returning it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good, how can I use this in our controllers? Like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;controllers.js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;line-numbers&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;line-number&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;controller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'MainCtrl'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;UserInformation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;UserInformation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;controller&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'SecondCtrl'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;UserInformation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;$scope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;UserInformation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;line&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Try it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  MainCtrl:
  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
  SecondCtrl:
  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well this seems to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the service is a singleton, if we update it from one controller, the other will be updated too. So your question now is. Where the &lt;code&gt;UserInformation&lt;/code&gt; parameter comes from?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angular uses &lt;code&gt;dependency injection&lt;/code&gt; to inject the services where we need them. Explaining how the &lt;code&gt;dependency injection&lt;/code&gt; works is not a subject for this article. But in plain words, when we create a service, we can inject it in any controller, directive or even in another service. How? Just passing as a parameter the name of the service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#x2019;re maybe wondering if this is the same for &lt;code&gt;$scope&lt;/code&gt;. Well, $scope is maybe one of the exceptions that is not really a service that is injected into our controllers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this we end the first article (but not the last :)) article of this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angular.js is a great framework and I think that you are already in love with it. I expect to see you here for the next articles!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed it and I expect your comments :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

Android Fragmentation Visualized

<link>
http://opensignal.com/reports/fragmentation-2013/
</link>
<description>
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;contentContainer&quot; class=&quot;report&quot;&gt;
			&lt;ul class=&quot;stats&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11,868&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;small&gt;Distinct Android devices seen this year&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3,997&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;small&gt;Distinct Android devices seen last year&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;682,000&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;small&gt;Devices surveyed for this report.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;47.5%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;small&gt;Samsung's share of those devices.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;small&gt;Android versions still in use&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;37.9%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;small&gt;Android users on Jelly Bean&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fragmentation is both a strength and weakness of the Android ecosystem. When comparisons are made between Android and iOS the issue of different API levels, and the vastly different devices running them, is often emphasised. In this report we examine the extent of Android fragmentation and analyse its impact on both users and developers.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;h4&gt;The Problem:&lt;/h4&gt; 
			&lt;p&gt;Android devices come in all shapes and sizes, with vastly different performance levels and screen sizes.  Furthermore, there are many different versions of Android that are concurrently active at any one time, adding another level of fragmentation. What this means is that developing apps that work across the whole range of Android devices can be extremely challenging and time-consuming. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;h4&gt;The Advantage:&lt;/h4&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Despite the problems, fragmentation also has a great number of benefits &amp;#x2013; for both developers and users. The availability of cheap Android phones (rarely running the most recent version) means that they have a much greater global reach than iOS, so app developers have a wider audience to build for. It may be tricky to do, but the potential reward definitely makes it worthwhile.  For consumers, extreme fragmentation means that they can get exactly the phone they want &amp;#x2013; big or small, cheap or expensive, with any number of different feature combinations.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;
				&lt;h2&gt;Device Fragmentation&lt;/h2&gt;
				&lt;/p&gt;
	
				

			&lt;h3 class=&quot;quote right&quot;&gt;We have seen 11,868 distinct devices download our app in the past few months. In our report last year we saw 3,997.&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;This is the best way of visualizing the sheer number of different Android devices that have downloaded the OpenSignal app in the past few months. From a developer&amp;#x2019;s perspective, comparing fragmentation from this year to the previous year, we see that it has tripled, with even more &lt;a href=&quot;http://opensignal.com/blog/?p=8917&quot;&gt; obscure devices&lt;/a&gt; from around the world downloading the app. If you want to understand the challenge of building an app that will work on all devices that want to download it, this image is a good place to start!&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;
				&lt;h2&gt;Brand Fragmentation&lt;/h2&gt;
				&lt;/p&gt;
			
	    	

			
			&lt;h3 class=&quot;quote right&quot;&gt;Samsung have a 47.5% share of the Android market.&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A similar look by brand, to see how much of the market each leading device manufacturer currently has, with Samsung clearly way out in front. Calculating the percentage share of the market held by the top few device manufacturers from our graphic really succeeds in emphasising quite how dominant Samsung are, with Sony-Ericsson in second with a 6.5% market share - less than 1/6th of Samsung's. Some of the brand names shown as different in the graphic are part of the same company, i.e. Moto and Motorola are the same and HTC is shown as split up into its different regional variants. But even when unified under one umbrella name Motorola only ends up with a 4.2% share and HTC even less at 3.9%. &lt;/p&gt; 

			&lt;p class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;
				&lt;h2&gt;Android Operating System Fragmentation&lt;/h2&gt;
				&lt;/p&gt;

			
			
			&lt;h3 class=&quot;quote left&quot;&gt;The Android operating system is the most fragmented it has ever been. &lt;/h3&gt;
			Device fragmentation is not the only challenge that developers face when building for Android; the operating system itself is extremely fragmented and has only become more so over time. The above graph shows the relative stages of Android fragmentation, and the steady decline of any one Android version having prominence can be seen by the progress of the white line. 
			&lt;p class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;
				&lt;h2&gt;Comparison with iOS&lt;/h2&gt;
				&lt;/p&gt;

			
			
		

			&lt;p&gt;Android fragmentation of all kinds is usually illustrated in comparison with iOS. These two pie charts clearly show the difference in API fragmentation between the two competing operating systems.
 &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;
				&lt;h2&gt;Screen Sizes&lt;/h2&gt;
				&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Key to the success of any app is getting the UI right, and Android presents two particular challenges to developers in this regard. Firstly, brands have a tendency to produce their own variants on the system UI (Samsung&amp;#x2019;s Touchwhizz and the HTC Sense being two such examples - which can change the look of various default elements. Secondly, no other smartphone platform boasts such a proliferation of different screen sizes. For help in overcoming these difficulties see our &lt;a href=&quot;http://opensignal.com/blog/2013/07/30/40-developer-tips-for-android-optimization/&quot;&gt;40 developer tips for Android Optimization.&lt;/a&gt; In the graphic below you can see the various physical screensizes we have observed on Android phones, with the darkness of the lines representing their frequency. &lt;/p&gt;

			
				
			
			

&lt;p&gt;Designing and coding layouts that work well across all these screens is hugely challenging. Across the dozen or so iPod-touch, iPhones and iPad varieties there are just 4 different physical screen sizes - partly due to Apple's tendency to double pixel density while quadrupling resolution (e.g. iPad 2 -&amp;gt; iPad 3) maintaining the same physical screen size. The graphic below shows iOS screen size fragmentation, allowing for an easy comparison with Android.&lt;/p&gt; 
		
					
			

				&lt;p class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;
					&lt;h2&gt;So what does this mean?&lt;/h2&gt;
					&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Device fragmentation is increasing, and with it the reach and density of the Android operating system. While fragmentation certainly poses a headache to developers who have to test and optimize on an ever-increasing number of devices, the success of the of the Android ecosystem cannot be separated from its fragmented, free-for-all, nature. Similarly, it is easy for developers to bemoan API level fragmentation, but this is part-and-parcel of device fragmentation. Cheaper devices will struggle to run the most recent versions of Android and the fragmented operating system serves as an enabler of an ecosystem that is becoming more globally, and socio-economically, inclusive. &lt;/p&gt; 
			&lt;p&gt;Fragmentation is responsible for a broader, more geographically dispersed, Android market - but fragmentation isn&amp;#x2019;t simply limited to devices and operating systems. It is also important for developers to think about the impact of contextual fragmentation, the variety of differing contexts in which devices are actually used. What is relevant for one region may not be to another, and developers need to take into account differences in network performance and reliability when designing their apps - as well as the level of Wi-Fi access for apps which are particularly data heavy. Another relevant factor is battery life; while one day&amp;#x2019;s battery life may be acceptable in the developed world, it may well not cut it in developing markets. It is important to remember that the criteria against which app performance is judged can change by region, not simply by device. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;What is clear from this report is that Android fragmentation, of all varieties, is increasing. Too often this is treated as a problem with Android, rather than a strength, but we feel that this misses the bigger picture. While there are certainly problems associated with fragmentation (and as developers we know them all too well), it is wrong to suggest that it is only a downside. Apple are currently working on a lower-end device, increasing the fragmentation of their ecosystem in the process, suggesting that the Android ecosystem is not only doing something right, but doing something to be imitated.&lt;/p&gt;
 

			&lt;p class=&quot;separator&quot;&gt;
				&lt;h2&gt;Notes on Methodology&lt;/h2&gt;
				&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;The Device Fragmentation Graphic&lt;/b&gt; shows the 11,828 distinct device types that were present in the last 682,000 unique devices to download our app. The reason we chose 682,000 is because we wanted to make a fair comparison with last year's fragmentation report, which was based on a sample of 682,000 devices over a set period of time. &lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;The Brand Fragmentation Graphic&lt;/b&gt; is based on the same 682,000 devices as the device fragmentation graphic. &lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;The API Level Fragmentation Graphic&lt;/b&gt; is based on data made publicly available by Google (though it involved some digging). The stats up until Feb 2012 were collated by Chris Sauve &lt;a href=&quot;http://pxldot.com/18281312362&quot;&gt;here &lt;/a&gt; and he has our eternal thanks. Also a thank you to /u/ikjadoon on Reddit who pointed us in his direction!&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;The iOS Pie Chart&lt;/b&gt; is based on information made publicly available by Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;The Android Screen Size Graphic&lt;/b&gt; is based on information from 3.41 million OpenSignal users. In this graphic we are showing physical screen size, not size in pixels. Changes in resolution at the same screen size (for example as between the iPad 3 and iPad 2) present fewer difficulties for developers than changes in physical size. We derive the screen size by dividing the number of pixels of height and width by the pixel density (points per inch - ppi). Ideally we would use separate values for X-density and Y-density as screens are sometimes manufactured with different ppi in different directions, however Android only gives access to one variable. Also worth noting: with rooted devices users are able to &amp;#x201C;alter&amp;#x201D; the pixel density - in reality the physical characteristics of the screen stay the same, but the Android OS thinks it&amp;#x2019;s running on a larger device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;http://norvig.com/21-days.html&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Then install GNU Emacs 24.3:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Debian: apt-get install emacs (or see your distro instructions)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;MacOSX: http://emacsformacosx.com/emacs-builds/Emacs-24.3-universal-10.6.8.dmg&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Windows: http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/windows/emacs/emacs-24.3-bin-i386.zip&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;More general information can be found at:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/#Obtaining&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fire up Emacs.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Look at the gray line at the bottom of the window:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;*scratch*&quot; is the name of the editing space you are now in.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;: This editing space is called a &quot;buffer&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The scratch buffer is the default buffer when opening Emacs.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;You are never editing files: you are editing buffers that you&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;can save to a file.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot;Lisp interaction&quot; refers to a set of commands available here.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This set of command is loaded on top of core Emacs commands.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;For exemple, `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;save-buffer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;' is a core Emacs command to save a&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;buffer to its associated file, and `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;eval-defun&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;' is a command&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;loaded from the `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;lisp-interaction-mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;' you are now in.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Semi-columns start comments anywhere on a line.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Elisp programs are made of symbolic expressions (&quot;sexps&quot;):&lt;/span&gt;
(+ 2 2)

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This symbolic expression reads as &quot;Add 2 to 2&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sexps are enclosed into parentheses, possibly nested:&lt;/span&gt;
(+ 2 (+ 1 1))

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;A symbolic expression contains atoms or other symbolic&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;expressions.  In the above examples, 1 and 2 are atoms,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(+ 2 (+ 1 1)) and (+ 1 1) are symbolic expressions.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;From `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;lisp-interaction-mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;' you can evaluate sexps.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Put the cursor right after the closing parenthesis then&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;hit the control and the j keys (&quot;C-j&quot; for short).&lt;/span&gt;

(+ 3 (+ 1 2))
&lt;span&gt;;;           &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;^ cursor here&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;C-j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;' =&amp;gt; 6&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;C-j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;' inserts the result of the evaluation in the buffer.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;C-xC-e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;' displays the same result in Emacs bottom line,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;: called the &quot;minibuffer&quot;.  We will generally use `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;C-xC-e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;',&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;as we don't want to clutter the buffer with useless text.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;setq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;' stores a value into a variable:&lt;/span&gt;
(setq my-name &lt;span&gt;&quot;Bastien&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;C-xC-e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;' =&amp;gt; &quot;Bastien&quot; (displayed in the mini-buffer)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;insert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;' will insert &quot;Hello!&quot; where the cursor is:&lt;/span&gt;
(insert &lt;span&gt;&quot;Hello!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;C-xC-e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;' =&amp;gt; &quot;Hello!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;We used `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;insert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;' with only one argument &quot;Hello!&quot;, but&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;we can pass more arguments -- here we use two:&lt;/span&gt;

(insert &lt;span&gt;&quot;Hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&quot; world!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;C-xC-e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;' =&amp;gt; &quot;Hello world!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can use variables instead of strings:&lt;/span&gt;
(insert &lt;span&gt;&quot;Hello, I am &quot;&lt;/span&gt; my-name)
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;C-xC-e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;' =&amp;gt; &quot;Hello, I am Bastien&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can combine sexps into functions:&lt;/span&gt;
(&lt;span&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt; () (insert &lt;span&gt;&quot;Hello, I am &quot;&lt;/span&gt; my-name))
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;C-xC-e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;' =&amp;gt; hello&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can evaluate functions:&lt;/span&gt;
(hello)
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;C-xC-e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;' =&amp;gt; Hello, I am Bastien&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The empty parentheses in the function's definition means that&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;it does not accept arguments.  But always using `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;my-name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;' is&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;boring, let's tell the function to accept one argument (here&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;the argument is called &quot;name&quot;): &lt;/span&gt;

(&lt;span&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt; (name) (insert &lt;span&gt;&quot;Hello &quot;&lt;/span&gt; name))
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;C-xC-e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;' =&amp;gt; hello&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now let's call the function with the string &quot;you&quot; as the value&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;for its unique argument:&lt;/span&gt;
(hello &lt;span&gt;&quot;you&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;C-xC-e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;' =&amp;gt; &quot;Hello you&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yeah!&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Take a breath.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now switch to a new buffer named &quot;*test*&quot; in another window:&lt;/span&gt;

(switch-to-buffer-other-window &lt;span&gt;&quot;*test*&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;C-xC-e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;: =&amp;gt; [screen has two windows and cursor is in the *test* buffer]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Use the mouse to go back to the window where you code.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can combine several sexps with `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;progn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;':&lt;/span&gt;
(&lt;span&gt;progn&lt;/span&gt;
  (switch-to-buffer-other-window &lt;span&gt;&quot;*test*&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
  (hello &lt;span&gt;&quot;you&quot;&lt;/span&gt;))
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;C-xC-e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;: =&amp;gt; [The screen has two windows and cursor is in the *test* buffer]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now if you don't mind, I'll stop asking you to hit `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;C-xC-e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;': do it&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;for every sexp that follows.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It's often useful to erase the buffer:&lt;/span&gt;
(&lt;span&gt;progn&lt;/span&gt;
  (switch-to-buffer-other-window &lt;span&gt;&quot;*test*&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
  (erase-buffer)
  (hello &lt;span&gt;&quot;you&quot;&lt;/span&gt;))

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Or to go back to the other window:&lt;/span&gt;
(&lt;span&gt;progn&lt;/span&gt;
  (switch-to-buffer-other-window &lt;span&gt;&quot;*test*&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
  (erase-buffer)
  (hello &lt;span&gt;&quot;you&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
  (other-window 1))

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can bind a value to a local variable with `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;':&lt;/span&gt;
(&lt;span&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; ((local-name &lt;span&gt;&quot;you&quot;&lt;/span&gt;))
  (switch-to-buffer-other-window &lt;span&gt;&quot;*test*&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
  (erase-buffer)
  (hello local-name)
  (other-window 1))

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;No need to use `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;progn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;' in that case, since `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;' also combines&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;several sexps.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let's format a string:&lt;/span&gt;
(format &lt;span&gt;&quot;Hello %s!\n&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&quot;visitor&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;%s is a place-holder for a string, replaced by &quot;Alice&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\n is the newline character.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let's refine our function by using format:&lt;/span&gt;
(&lt;span&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt; (name)
  (insert (format &lt;span&gt;&quot;Hello %s!\n&quot;&lt;/span&gt; name)))

(hello &lt;span&gt;&quot;you&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let's create another function which uses `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;':&lt;/span&gt;
(&lt;span&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;greeting&lt;/span&gt; (name)
  (&lt;span&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; ((your-name &lt;span&gt;&quot;Bastien&quot;&lt;/span&gt;))
    (insert (format &lt;span&gt;&quot;Hello %s!\n\nI'am %s.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
                    name       &lt;span&gt;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;the argument of the function&lt;/span&gt;
                    your-name  &lt;span&gt;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;the let-bound variable &quot;Roger&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
                    ))))

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;And evaluate it:&lt;/span&gt;
(greeting &lt;span&gt;&quot;you&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some function are interactive:&lt;/span&gt;
(read-from-minibuffer &lt;span&gt;&quot;Enter your name: &quot;&lt;/span&gt;)

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Evaluating this function returns what you entered at the prompt.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let's make our `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;greeting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;' function prompts for your name:&lt;/span&gt;
(&lt;span&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;greeting&lt;/span&gt; (from-name)
  (&lt;span&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; ((your-name (read-from-minibuffer &lt;span&gt;&quot;Enter your name: &quot;&lt;/span&gt;)))
    (insert (format &lt;span&gt;&quot;Hello!\n\I am %s and you are %s.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
                    from-name &lt;span&gt;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;the argument of the function&lt;/span&gt;
                    your-name &lt;span&gt;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;the let-bound var, entered at prompt&lt;/span&gt;
                    ))))

(greeting &lt;span&gt;&quot;Bastien&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let complete it by displaying the results in the other window:&lt;/span&gt;
(&lt;span&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;greeting&lt;/span&gt; (from-name)
  (&lt;span&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; ((your-name (read-from-minibuffer &lt;span&gt;&quot;Enter your name: &quot;&lt;/span&gt;)))
    (switch-to-buffer-other-window &lt;span&gt;&quot;*test*&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
    (erase-buffer)
    (insert (format &lt;span&gt;&quot;Hello %s!\n\nI'am %s.&quot;&lt;/span&gt; your-name from-name))
    (other-window 1)))

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now test it:&lt;/span&gt;
(greeting &lt;span&gt;&quot;Bastien&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Take a breath.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let's store a list of names:&lt;/span&gt;
(setq list-of-names '(&lt;span&gt;&quot;Sarah&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&quot;Chloe&quot;&lt;/span&gt;))

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Get the first element of this list with `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;car&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;':&lt;/span&gt;
(car list-of-names)

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Get a list of all but the first element with `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;cdr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;':&lt;/span&gt;
(cdr list-of-names)

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Add an element to the beginning of a list with `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;':&lt;/span&gt;
(push &lt;span&gt;&quot;Stephanie&quot;&lt;/span&gt; list-of-names)

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;NOTE: `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;car&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;' and `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;cdr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;' don't modify the list, but `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;' does.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let's call `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;' for each element in `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;list-of-names&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;':&lt;/span&gt;
(mapcar 'hello list-of-names)

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Refine `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;greeting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;' to say hello to everyone in `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;list-of-names&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;':&lt;/span&gt;
(&lt;span&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;greeting&lt;/span&gt; ()
    (switch-to-buffer-other-window &lt;span&gt;&quot;*test*&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
    (erase-buffer)
    (mapcar 'hello list-of-names)
    (other-window 1))

(greeting)

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Remember the `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;' function we defined above?  It takes one&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;argument, a name.  `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;mapcar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;' calls `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;', successively using each&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;element of `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;list-of-names&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;' as the argument for `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;'.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now let's arrange a bit what we have in the displayed buffer:&lt;/span&gt;

(&lt;span&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;replace-hello-by-bonjour&lt;/span&gt; ()
    (switch-to-buffer-other-window &lt;span&gt;&quot;*test*&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (&lt;span&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; (search-forward &lt;span&gt;&quot;Hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
      (replace-match &lt;span&gt;&quot;Bonjour&quot;&lt;/span&gt;))
    (other-window 1))

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(goto-char (point-min)) goes to the beginning of the buffer.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(search-forward &quot;Hello&quot;) searches for the string &quot;Hello&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(while x y) evaluates the y sexp(s) while x returns something.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;If x returns `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;' (nothing), we exit the while loop.&lt;/span&gt;

(replace-hello-by-bonjour)

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;You should see all occurrences of &quot;Hello&quot; in the *test* buffer&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;replaced by &quot;Bonjour&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;You should also get an error: &quot;Search failed: Hello&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;You need to tell search-forward whether it should stop searching&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;at some point in the buffer, and whether it should silently fail&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;when nothing is found:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(search-forward &quot;Hello&quot; nil t) does it.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;' argument says: the search is not bound to a position.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The `t' argument says: silently fail when nothing is found.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;We do it here, in a new function that also says &quot;Hello first&quot;:&lt;/span&gt;

(&lt;span&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;hello-to-bonjour&lt;/span&gt; ()

    (mapcar 'hello list-of-names)
    (goto-char (point-min))
    &lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Replace &quot;Hello&quot; by &quot;Bonjour&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

      (replace-match &lt;span&gt;&quot;Bonjour&quot;&lt;/span&gt;))
    (other-window 1))

(hello-to-bonjour)

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let's colorize the names:&lt;/span&gt;

(&lt;span&gt;defun&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;boldify-names&lt;/span&gt; ()
    (switch-to-buffer-other-window &lt;span&gt;&quot;*test*&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)

    (&lt;span&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; (re-search-forward &lt;span&gt;&quot;Bonjour &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;\\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;!&quot;&lt;/span&gt; nil t)
      (add-text-properties (match-beginning 1)

                           (list 'face 'bold)))
    (other-window 1))

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This functions introduces `&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;re-search-forward&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;': instead of&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;searching for the string &quot;Bonjour&quot;, you search for a pattern,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;using a &quot;regular expression&quot; (abbreviated in the prefix &quot;re-&quot;).&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The regular expression is &quot;Bonjour \\(.+\\)!&quot; and it reads:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;the string &quot;Bonjour &quot;, and&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;a group of           | this is the \\( ... \\) construct&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;any character      | this is the .&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;possibly repeated  | this is the +&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;and the &quot;!&quot; string.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ready?  Test it!&lt;/span&gt;

(boldify-names)

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;add-text-properties&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;' adds... text properties, like a face.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span&gt;;; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;OK, we are done.  Happy hacking!&lt;/span&gt;

Why I Left Medium

<description>
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-18466 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-development&quot;&gt;													
			
			
			
																							
		    			&lt;img src=&quot;http://i0.wp.com/kennethreitz.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_0033.jpg?resize=960%2C260&quot; class=&quot;postThumb wp-post-image&quot; alt=&quot;Why I Left Medium&quot; title=&quot;Why I Left Medium&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I decided to move all of my content over to Medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you aren&amp;#x2019;t aware, &lt;a href=&quot;http://medium.com&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; is a new content platform designed for readers and writers. Its main draw is an elegant writing interface combined with the ability to comment on specific pieces of text, instead of on an article as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was finding myself a bit frustrated with my online presence &amp;#x2014;&amp;#xA0;torn between voices of code, travel, photography, and music. I was originally going to dive head-first into a content-negotiated &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kennethreitz/blackbox&quot;&gt;BlackBox&lt;/a&gt;-driven experience where all of my content was indexed, searchable, archived automatically on Archive.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found myself heavily over-engineering &amp;#x2014; I need those decisions to be taken away from me. I needed a change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medium seemed like the antithesis to over-engineering. It has great typography, encourages collaboration, forces photos for ever post, and is responsive. What&amp;#x2019;s not to love?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Honeymoon Phase&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I spent an afternoon moving all of my content over to Medium, adding beautiful heading photos to every post. Once complete, I shut my old site down permanently, a site that I had been maintaining (in some form or another) since 2007. To lazily prevent link-rot, I setup a simple blanket 301 redirect from the old domain to my profile on Medium. Things felt right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a big deal for me. Myself from three years ago would be having a panic attack from the idea of just shoving all my content on a different domain without rhyme or reason. In 2009, I would obsess over PageRank and SEO. Myself from today doesn&amp;#x2019;t care that much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I flipped the switch, I excitedly started a few dozen draft posts, serializing all the half-baked ideas I had been collecting in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZYF22M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B000ZYF22M&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=bookforkind-20&quot;&gt;my notebook&lt;/a&gt;. As months went by, I found myself happily writing as my traffic slowly declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#x2019;t the end of the world, but here&amp;#x2019;s the kicker &amp;#x2014;&amp;#xA0;I couldn&amp;#x2019;t do &lt;strong&gt;anything&lt;/strong&gt; about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writers: You don&amp;#x2019;t need Medium. You can host your own blog on your own domain with lots of other tools and hosts.

Be your own &amp;#x201C;platform&amp;#x201D;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x2014; Marco Arment (@marcoarment) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/marcoarment/statuses/362613401861636098&quot;&gt;July 31, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I couldn&amp;#x2019;t embed any content in a post. Not even that tweet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I couldn&amp;#x2019;t track referrers to know where my readers are coming from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I couldn&amp;#x2019;t search Twitter for people sharing my posts because the URLs are on a massively shared domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I couldn&amp;#x2019;t even use &lt;a href=&quot;http://gaug.es/&quot;&gt;gaug.es&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I couldn&amp;#x2019;t pick my own URLs. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I couldn&amp;#x2019;t do anything but keep writing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt dead inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Back to WordPress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I created an account on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pagodabox.com/&quot;&gt;PagodaBox&lt;/a&gt; (which I &lt;em&gt;highly&lt;/em&gt; recommend), and setup WordPress for the first time in over three years. I searched around for a theme that resonated with me, and with a little bit of typographic collaboration from &lt;a href=&quot;http://gazit.me/&quot;&gt;Idan Gazit&lt;/a&gt;, my website is now better than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I even found an old backup of my old WordPress website and merged in all of my old content. Even &lt;a href=&quot;http://kennethreitz.org/hacker-identity/&quot;&gt;the embarrassing stuff&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#x2019;m writing again. I&amp;#x2019;m in control again. It feels good. I&amp;#x2019;m here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;tl;dr&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medium really is a great platform if you just want to write. Unfortunately, for me, that just wasn&amp;#x2019;t my problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pub Trivia&lt;/strong&gt;: The dude in the photo at the top is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maxfenton.com/&quot;&gt;Max Fenton&lt;/a&gt;, lost in his work as Readability&amp;#x2019;s Community Manager a few years ago. He&amp;#x2019;s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

NSA Collects 'Word for Word' Every Domestic Communication, Says Former Analyst
</title>
<link>
http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/government_programs/july-dec13/whistleblowers_08-01.html

&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;copy&quot;&gt;	
							
							&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JUDY WOODRUFF:&amp;#xA0; &amp;#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;And we pick up on the continuing fallout from the revelations of former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. Last night, we debated the role of the Foreign Surveillance Intelligence court, which approves the government's requests to gather intelligence information on Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, we have a conversation with three former NSA officials, a former inspector general and two NSA veterans who blew the whistle on what they say were abuses and mismanagement at the secret government intelligence agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Binney worked at the NSA for over three decades as a mathematician, where he designed systems for collecting and analyzing large amounts of data. He retired in 2001. And Russell Tice had a two-decade career with the NSA where he focused on collection and analysis. He says he was fired in 2005 after calling on Congress to provide greater protection to whistle-blowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He claims the NSA tapped the phone of high-level government officials and the news media 10 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RUSSELL TICE&lt;/strong&gt;, former National Security Agency analyst: The United States were, at that time, using satellites to spy on American citizens. At that time, it was news organizations, the State Department, including Colin Powell, and an awful lot of senior military people and industrial types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JUDY WOODRUFF:&amp;#xA0; &amp;#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;So, this is the early 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;div class=&quot;PullOutColumn&quot;&gt;
								&lt;div class=&quot;PullOutColumn_pad&quot;&gt;
									&lt;div class=&quot;PullOutColumn_box&quot;&gt;									
										&lt;p class=&quot;PullOutColumn_videoheader&quot;&gt;RELATED INFORMATION&lt;/p&gt;

										&lt;p class=&quot;PullOutColumn_video&quot;&gt;How Much the Government Monitor Phone, Internet Activity?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
								&lt;/div&gt;
							&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RUSSELL TICE:&lt;/strong&gt; This was in 2002-2003 time frame. The NSA were targeting individuals. In that case, they were judges like the Supreme Court. I held in my hand Judge Alito's targeting information for his phones and his staff and his family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JUDY WOODRUFF:&amp;#xA0; &amp;#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;Bill Binney, what was your sense of who was being targeted and why they were being targeted? And what was being collected, in other words?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WILLIAM BINNEY&lt;/strong&gt;, former National Security Agency technical leader: Well, I wasn't aware of specific targeting like Russ was. I just saw the inputs were including hundreds of millions of records of phone calls of U.S. citizens every day. So it was virtually -- there wasn't anybody who wasn't a part of this collection of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, virtually, you could target anybody in this country you wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JUDY WOODRUFF:&amp;#xA0; &amp;#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;Both Binney and Tice suspect that today, the NSA is doing more than just collecting metadata on calls made in the U.S. They both point to this CNN interview by former FBI counterterrorism agent Tim Clemente days after the Boston Marathon bombing. Clemente was asked if the government had a way to get the recordings of the calls between Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIM CLEMENTE&lt;/strong&gt;, former FBI counterterrorism agent: On the national security side of the house, in the federal government, you know, we have assets. There are lots of assets at our disposal throughout the intelligence community and also not just domestically, but overseas. Those assets allow us to gain information, intelligence on things that we can't use ordinarily in a criminal investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All digital communications are -- there's a way to look at digital communications in the past. And I can't go into detail of how that's done or what's done. But I can tell you that no digital communication is secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JUDY WOODRUFF:&amp;#xA0; &amp;#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;Tice says after he saw this interview on television, he called some former workmates at the NSA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RUSSELL TICE:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, two months ago, I contacted some colleagues at NSA. We had a little meeting, and the question came up, was NSA collecting everything now? Because we kind of figured that was the goal all along. And the answer came back. It was, yes, they are collecting everything, contents word for word, everything of every domestic communication in this country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JUDY WOODRUFF:&amp;#xA0; &amp;#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;Both of you know what the government says is that we're collecting this -- we're collecting the number of phone calls that are made, the e-mails, but we're not listening to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WILLIAM BINNEY:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, I don't believe that for a minute. OK?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, that's why they had to build Bluffdale, that facility in Utah with that massive amount of storage that could store all these recordings and all the data being passed along the fiberoptic networks of the world. I mean, you could store 100 years of the world's communications here. That's for content storage. That's not for metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metadata if you were doing it and putting it into the systems we built, you could do it in a 12-by-20-foot room for the world. That's all the space you need. You don't need 100,000 square feet of space that they have at Bluffdale to do that. You need that kind of storage for content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JUDY WOODRUFF:&amp;#xA0; &amp;#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;So, what does that say, Russell Tice, about what the government -- you're saying -- your understanding is of what the government does once these conversations take place, is it your understanding they're recorded and kept?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RUSSELL TICE:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, digitized and recorded and archived in a facility that is now online. And they're kind of fibbing about that as well, because Bluffdale is online right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's where the information is going. Now, as far as being able to have an analyst look at all that, that's impossible, of course. And I think, semantically, they're trying to say that their definition of collection is having literally a physical analyst look or listen, which would be disingenuous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JUDY WOODRUFF:&amp;#xA0; &amp;#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;But the government vehemently denies it is recording all telephone calls. Robert Litt is the general counsel in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. He recently spoke at the Brookings Institution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ROBERT LITT&lt;/strong&gt;, NSA general counsel: We do not indiscriminately sweep up and store the contents of the communications of Americans or of the citizenry of any country. We do collect metadata, information about communications, more broadly than we collect the actual content of communications, but that's because it is less intrusive than collecting content and in fact can provide us information that helps us more narrowly focus our collection of content on appropriate foreign intelligence targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it simply is not true that the United States government is listening to everything said by the citizens of any country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JUDY WOODRUFF:&amp;#xA0; &amp;#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;Joel Brenner, who was the NSA's inspector general and then senior legal counsel, says the intelligence agency obeys the law and the directions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOEL BRENNER&lt;/strong&gt;, former NSA inspector general: It's really important to understand that the NSA hasn't done anything, as I understand it and from all I know, that goes one inch beyond what it's been authorized to do by a court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JUDY WOODRUFF:&amp;#xA0; &amp;#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;So, tell us, how extensive is the NSA's collection of data on American citizens, on their phone calls, on their e-mails, on their use of the Internet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOEL BRENNER:&lt;/strong&gt; This the program only involves telephony metadata, not e-mails, not geographic location information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that NSA is keeping files on Americans, as a general rule, just isn't true. There's no basis for believing that. The idea that NSA is compiling dossiers on people the way J. Edgar Hoover did in the '40s and '50s or the way the East German police did, as some people allege, that's just not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JUDY WOODRUFF:&amp;#xA0; &amp;#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;Well, we have been talking to a couple of former NSA employees and one of the allegations they make is that it's not just collecting this metadata on telephone conversations; it's recording those conversations and it's storing them and keeping them for possible future use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOEL BRENNER:&lt;/strong&gt; I think you're talking about Mr. Tice and Mr. Binney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Binney hasn't been at the agency since 2001. Mr. Tice hasn't been at the agency since 2005. They don't know what's going on inside the agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JUDY WOODRUFF:&amp;#xA0; &amp;#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;Another allegation we heard from them, from Mr. Tice, is that back as of the time before he left the NSA in the early 2000s, that there was spying going on, on news organizations, on Supreme Court justices, on presidential candidates, then Senator Barack Obama, on military leaders, top generals in the army.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOEL BRENNER:&lt;/strong&gt; Mr. Tice made the allegations you have just indicated having to do with the period before 2005, eight years ago. They're just coming out now. I wonder why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The farther he gets from the period when he could have known what he was talking about, the more fanciful his allegations have become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JUDY WOODRUFF:&amp;#xA0; &amp;#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;Brenner claims that oversight of information gathering has actually improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOEL BRENNER:&lt;/strong&gt; We have turned intelligence into a regulated industry in a way that none of our allies, even in Europe, have done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have all three branches of government now involved in overseeing the activities of the NSA, the CIA, the DIA, and our other intelligence apparatus. This is an enormous achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MAN:&lt;/strong&gt; Government has gone too far in the name of security, that the Fourth Amendment has been bruised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JUDY WOODRUFF:&amp;#xA0; &amp;#xA0;&lt;/strong&gt;Last week, one oversight proposal in Congress aimed at preventing the NSA from collecting date on phone calls was narrowly defeated, but some members are vowing to press for additional restrictions on the investigative agency.&lt;/p&gt;

Forebruary, an endless wall calendar

&lt;div class=&quot;frame&quot;&gt;    












  


&lt;div class=&quot;main&quot;&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Forebruary is a wall calendar that you do not need to replace every year. The movable frame above the surface contains the month needed:&lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;http://ilyabirman.net/projects/forebruary/i/forebruary-body.jpg&quot; width=&quot;890&quot; alt=&quot;Forebruary, an endless calendar&quot; class=&quot;cal-body&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
  
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;main&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The red stripe highlights the weekend. For the United States, where week starts on Sunday (but it is anyway considered a part of week&lt;i&gt;end&lt;/i&gt;), alternative frames can be produced.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;

&lt;nyt_byline&gt;
&lt;/nyt_byline&gt;

&lt;meta name=&quot;emailThisHash&quot; value=&quot;lmkUWkr6Fp1iLeW++0j4Yg&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;articleBody&quot;&gt;
&lt;span&gt;
&lt;meta value=&quot;The New York Times Company&quot;&gt;&lt;meta value=&quot;http://www.nytco.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;meta value=&quot;NYSE NYT&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;meta value=&quot;2013&quot;&gt;&lt;nyt_text&gt;&lt;nyt_correction_top&gt;&lt;/nyt_correction_top&gt;&lt;p&gt;
WASHINGTON — The movement to crack down on government surveillance started with an odd couple from Michigan, Representatives Justin Amash, a young libertarian Republican known even to his friends as “chief wing nut,” and John Conyers Jr., an elder of the liberal left in his 25th House term.        &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/nyt_text&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;articleBody&quot; score=&quot;30.0&quot;&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
But what began on the political fringes only a week ago has built a momentum that even critics say may be unstoppable, drawing support from Republican and Democratic leaders, attracting moderates in both parties and pulling in some of the most respected voices on national security in the House.        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The rapidly shifting politics were reflected clearly in the House on Wednesday, when a plan to defund the &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_security_agency/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about National Security Agency, U.S.&quot; class=&quot;meta-org&quot;&gt;National Security Agency&lt;/a&gt;’s telephone data collection program &lt;a title=&quot;Times article&quot; href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/25/us/politics/house-defeats-effort-to-rein-in-nsa-data-gathering.html&quot;&gt;fell just seven votes short of passage&lt;/a&gt;. Now, after initially signaling that they were comfortable with the scope of the N.S.A.’s collection of Americans’ phone and Internet activities, but not their content, revealed last month by Edward J. Snowden, lawmakers are showing an increasing willingness to use legislation to curb those actions.        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Representatives Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, and Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California, have begun work on legislation in the House Judiciary Committee to significantly rein in N.S.A. telephone surveillance. Mr. Sensenbrenner said on Friday that he would have a bill ready when Congress returned from its August recess that would restrict phone surveillance to only those named as targets of a federal terrorism investigation, make significant changes to &lt;a title=&quot;Times article&quot; href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/07/us/in-secret-court-vastly-broadens-powers-of-nsa.html&quot;&gt;the secret court&lt;/a&gt; that oversees such programs and give businesses like Microsoft and Google permission to reveal their dealings before that court.        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“There is a growing sense that things have really gone a-kilter here,” Ms. Lofgren said.        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The sudden reconsideration of post-Sept. 11 counterterrorism policy has taken much of Washington by surprise. As &lt;a title=&quot;Times article&quot; href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/11/us/how-edward-j-snowden-orchestrated-a-blockbuster-story.html&quot;&gt;the revelations&lt;/a&gt; by Mr. Snowden, a former N.S.A. contractor, were gaining attention in the news media, the White House and leaders in both parties stood united behind the programs he had unmasked. They were focused mostly on bringing the leaker to justice.        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Backers of sweeping surveillance powers now say they recognize that changes are likely, and they are taking steps to make sure they maintain control over the extent of any revisions. Leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee met on Wednesday as the House deliberated to try to find accommodations to growing public misgivings about the programs, said the committee’s chairwoman, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California.        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Senator Mark Udall, a Colorado Democrat and longtime critic of the N.S.A. surveillance programs, said he had taken part in serious meetings to discuss changes.        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, the ranking Republican on the panel, said, “We’re talking through it right now.” He added, “There are a lot of ideas on the table, and it’s pretty obvious that we’ve got some uneasy folks.”        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Representative Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has assured House colleagues that an intelligence policy bill he plans to draft in mid-September will include new privacy safeguards.        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Aides familiar with his efforts said the House Intelligence Committee was focusing on more transparency for the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which oversees data gathering, including possibly declassifying that court’s orders, and changes to the way the surveillance data is stored. The legislation may order such data to be held by the telecommunications companies that produce them or by an independent entity, not the government.        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Lawmakers say their votes to restrain the N.S.A. reflect a gut-level concern among voters about personal privacy.        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“I represent a very reasonable district in suburban Philadelphia, and my constituents are expressing a growing concern on the sweeping amounts of data that the government is compiling,” said Representative Michael G. Fitzpatrick, a moderate Republican who represents one of the few true swing districts left in the House and who voted on Wednesday to limit N.S.A. surveillance.        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Votes from the likes of Mr. Fitzpatrick were not initially anticipated when Republican leaders chided reporters for their interest in legislation that they said would go nowhere. As the House slowly worked its way on Wednesday toward an evening vote to curb government surveillance, even proponents of the legislation jokingly predicted that only the “wing nuts” — the libertarians of the right, the most ardent liberals on the left — would support the measure.        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then Mr. Sensenbrenner, a Republican veteran and one of the primary authors of the post-Sept. 11 &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/u/usa_patriot_act/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier&quot; title=&quot;More articles about the USA Patriot Act.&quot; class=&quot;meta-classifier&quot;&gt;Patriot Act&lt;/a&gt;, stepped to a microphone on the House floor. Never, he said, did he intend to allow the wholesale vacuuming up of domestic phone records, nor did his legislation envision that data dragnets would go beyond specific targets of terrorism investigations.        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“The time has come to stop it, and the way we stop it is to approve this amendment,” Mr. Sensenbrenner said.        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
He had not intended to speak, and when he did, he did not say much, just seven brief sentences.        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“I was able to say what needed to be said in a minute,” he said Friday.        &lt;/p&gt;
         
      &lt;nyt_correction_bottom score=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;
&lt;/nyt_correction_bottom&gt;&lt;nyt_update_bottom&gt;&lt;/nyt_update_bottom&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;












&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class=&quot;rdb-page-break&quot; /&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;article&quot; score=&quot;40.0&quot;&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;columnGroup first&quot; score=&quot;22.5&quot;&gt;   &lt;div class=&quot;shareTools shareToolsThemeClassic articleShareToolsTop shareToolsInstance&quot; score=&quot;0.0&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;meta name=&quot;emailThisHash&quot; value=&quot;lmkUWkr6Fp1iLeW++0j4Yg&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;articleBody&quot; score=&quot;30.0&quot;&gt; &lt;span&gt; &lt;meta value=&quot;The New York Times Company&quot;&gt;&lt;meta value=&quot;http://www.nytco.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;meta value=&quot;NYSE NYT&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;meta value=&quot;2013&quot;&gt;&lt;nyt_text score=&quot;0.0&quot;&gt;&lt;nyt_correction_top&gt;&lt;/nyt_correction_top&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lawmakers from both parties said the brief speech was a pivotal moment. When the tally was final, the effort to end the N.S.A.’s programs had fallen short, &lt;a title=&quot;Tally of the vote&quot; href=&quot;http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll412.xml&quot;&gt;205 to 217&lt;/a&gt;. Supporters included Republican leaders like Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington and Democratic leaders like Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina. Republican moderates like Mr. Fitzpatrick and Blue Dog Democrats like Representative Kurt Schrader of Oregon joined with respected voices on national security matters like Mr. Sensenbrenner and Ms. Lofgren. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Besides Ms. McMorris Rodgers, Representative Lynn Jenkins of Kansas, another member of the Republican leadership, voted yes. On the Democratic side, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, Representative Xavier Becerra of California, and his vice chairman, Representative Joseph Crowley of New York, broke with the top two Democrats, Representatives Nancy Pelosi of California and Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, who pressed hard for no votes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Friday, Ms. Pelosi, the House minority leader and a veteran of the Intelligence Committee, and Mr. Hoyer dashed off a letter to the president warning that even those Democrats who had stayed with him on the issue on Wednesday would be seeking changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That letter included the signature of Mr. Conyers, who is rallying an increasingly unified Democratic caucus to his side, as well as 61 House Democrats who voted no on Wednesday but are now publicly signaling their discontent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Although some of us voted for and others against the amendment, we all agree that there are lingering questions and concerns about the current” data collection program, &lt;a title=&quot;The letter&quot; href=&quot;http://blogs.mcclatchydc.com/washington/2013/07/pelosi-153-house-democrats-tell-obama-of-lingering-questions-and-concerns-about-nsa-programs.html&quot;&gt;the letter stated&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Representative Reid Ribble of Wisconsin, a Republican who voted for the curbs and predicted that changes to the N.S.A. surveillance programs were now unstoppable, said: “This was in many respects a vote intended to send a message. The vote was just too strong.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ms. Lofgren said the White House and Democratic and Republican leaders had not come to grips with what she called “a grave sense of betrayal” that greeted Mr. Snowden’s revelations. Since the Bush administration, lawmakers had been repeatedly assured that such indiscriminate collection of data did not exist, and that when targeting was unspecific, it was aimed at people abroad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The movement against the N.S.A. began with the fringes of each party. Mr. Amash of Michigan began pressing for an amendment on the annual military spending bill aimed at the N.S.A. Leaders of the Intelligence Committee argued strenuously that such an amendment was not relevant to military spending and should be ruled out of order. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Mr. Amash, an acolyte of Ron Paul, a libertarian former congressman, persisted and rallied support. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mr. Sensenbrenner and Ms. Lofgren said they were willing to work with the House and Senate intelligence panels to overhaul the surveillance programs, but indicated that they did not believe those panels were ready to go far enough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “I would just hope the Intelligence Committees will not stick their heads in the sand on this,” Mr. Sensenbrenner said. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;nyt_correction_bottom score=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt; &lt;/nyt_correction_bottom&gt;&lt;nyt_update_bottom&gt;&lt;/nyt_update_bottom&gt;&lt;/nyt_text&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;             &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;article-content clearfix&quot; score=&quot;10.75&quot;&gt;
    
&lt;figure class=&quot;intro-image image center full-width&quot; score=&quot;12.5&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/you-slow.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot; score=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;
	  &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee Hutchinson has a problem. My fellow Ars writer is a man who loves to watch YouTube videos—mostly &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/science/2013/03/swimming-with-spacemen/&quot;&gt;space rocket launches&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/07/trackingpoint-aims-to-produce-super-gun-with-3000-yard-single-shot-accuracy/&quot;&gt;gun demonstrations&lt;/a&gt;, I assume—but he never knows when his home Internet service will let him do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;For at least the past year, I've suffered from ridiculously awful YouTube speeds,&quot; Hutchinson tells me. &quot;Ads load quickly—there's never anything wrong with the ads!—but during peak times, HD videos have been almost universally unwatchable. I've found myself having to reduce the quality down to 480p and sometimes even down to 240p to watch things without buffering. More recently, videos would start to play and buffer without issue, then simply stop buffering at some point between a third and two-thirds in. When the playhead hit the end of the buffer—which might be at 1:30 of a six-minute video—the video would hang for several seconds, then simply &lt;em&gt;end&lt;/em&gt;. The video's total time would change from six minutes to 1:30 minutes and I'd be presented with the standard 'related videos' view that you see when a video is over.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hutchinson, a Houston resident who pays Comcast for 16Mbps business-class cable, is far from alone. As one Ars reader recently &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/06/verizon-bandwidth-provider-blame-each-other-for-slow-netflix-streaming/?comments=1&amp;amp;post=24753839#comment-24753839&quot;&gt;complained&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;YouTube is almost unusable on my [Verizon] FiOS connection during peak hours.&quot; Another reader responded, &quot;To be fair, it's unusable with almost any ISP.&quot; Hutchinson's YouTube playback has actually gotten better in recent weeks. But complaints about streaming video services—notably YouTube and Netflix—are repeated again and again in &lt;a href=&quot;https://secure.dslreports.com/shownews/Why-Is-Everyone-Having-YouTube-Streaming-Issues-123282&quot;&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.comcast.com/t5/Xfinity-com-Website/Netflix-too-slow/td-p/1728879&quot;&gt;support forums&lt;/a&gt; across the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does online video have such problems? People may assume there are perfectly innocent causes related to their computers or to the mysterious workings of the Internet. Often, they're correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But cynical types who suspect their Internet Service Providers (ISPs) intentionally degrade streaming video may be right as well. No, your ISP (probably) isn't sniffing your traffic every time you click a YouTube or Netflix link, ready to throttle your bandwidth. But behind the scenes, in negotiations that almost never become public, the world's biggest Internet providers and video services argue over how much one network should pay to connect to another. When these negotiations fail, users suffer. In other words, bad video performance is often caused not just by technology problems but also by &lt;em&gt;business decisions&lt;/em&gt; made by the companies that control the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;video&quot; score=&quot;2.5&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot; score=&quot;20.0&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Please wait. Keep waiting.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These business decisions involve &quot;peering&quot; agreements that Internet companies make to pass traffic from one to another and negotiations over caching services that store videos closer to people's homes so they can load faster in your browser. When Internet providers refuse to upgrade peering connections, traffic gets congested. When ISPs refuse to use the caching services offered by the likes of Google and Netflix, video has to travel farther across the Internet to get to its final destination—your living room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The negotiations can lead to brinksmanship and bad blood. Recent public examples of such spats include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 2010&lt;/strong&gt;: After Internet backbone provider Level 3 signs a deal with Netflix to distribute video, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2010/12/comcastlevel3/&quot;&gt;Comcast demands money&lt;/a&gt; from Level 3 for carrying traffic over the proverbial &quot;last mile&quot; to Comcast subscribers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 2011&lt;/strong&gt;: European ISPs Deutsche Telekom, Orange (formerly France Telecom), Telecom Italia, and Telefónica &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/01/huge-isps-want-per-gb-payments-from-netflix-youtube/&quot;&gt;commission a report&lt;/a&gt; saying companies like Netflix and Google's YouTube service should give ISPs a lot more money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 2011&lt;/strong&gt;: Cogent, another Internet backbone provider that handles Netflix traffic, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fiercetelecom.com/story/cogent-and-orange-france-fight-over-interconnection-issues/2011-08-31&quot;&gt;files a complaint&lt;/a&gt; in France against Orange, saying the ISP is providing inadequate connection speeds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 2013&lt;/strong&gt;: Free, a French ISP, &lt;a href=&quot;http://gigaom.com/2013/01/02/youtube-sucks-on-french-isp-free-french-regulators-want-to-know-why/&quot;&gt;is accused&lt;/a&gt; of slowing down YouTube traffic by failing to upgrade infrastructure (but is later &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arcep.fr/index.php?id=8571&amp;amp;tx_gsactualite_pi1%5Buid%5D=1619&amp;amp;tx_gsactualite_pi1%5Bannee%5D=&amp;amp;tx_gsactualite_pi1%5Btheme%5D=&amp;amp;tx_gsactualite_pi1%5Bmotscle%5D=&amp;amp;tx_gsactualite_pi1%5BbackID%5D=26&amp;amp;cHash=3e1f6c03d0b85ed8e34f7b594f46e957&quot;&gt;cleared&lt;/a&gt; of intentionally degrading YouTube traffic by the French regulator). Free also &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/01/frances-second-largest-isp-suspends-ad-blocking-for-now/&quot;&gt;temporarily blocks ads&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube and other video services by sending an update to its modems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 2013&lt;/strong&gt;: Orange and Google have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fiercetelecom.com/story/france-telecom-and-google-entangled-peering-fight/2013-01-07&quot;&gt;similar dispute&lt;/a&gt;, with Orange CEO Stephane Richard claiming victory. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ipkAQJJNgj69HxLbKppH80WjUQJg&quot;&gt;He says&lt;/a&gt; that Google is paying Orange to compensate the operator for mobile traffic sent from Google servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 2013&lt;/strong&gt;: Time Warner &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/01/timewarner-net-neutrality-foes-cry-foul-netflix-requirements-for-super-hd/&quot;&gt;refuses Netflix's offer&lt;/a&gt; of a free caching service that would provide better performance to Netflix users on Time Warner's network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 2013&lt;/strong&gt;: Cogent &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/06/verizon-bandwidth-provider-blame-each-other-for-slow-netflix-streaming/&quot;&gt;accuses Verizon&lt;/a&gt; of allowing &quot;ports&quot; between the two providers to fill up, degrading Netflix performance for Verizon customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 2013&lt;/strong&gt;: The European Commission opens an antitrust probe into whether ISPs abused market positions in negotiations with content providers, and it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/11/eu-telecoms-idUSL6N0FH1OL20130711&quot;&gt;searches the offices&lt;/a&gt; of Orange, Deutsche Telekom, and Telefónica. Separately, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gigaom.com/2013/07/11/att-and-verizon-lose-bid-to-maintain-secrecy-of-french-interconnection-deals/&quot;&gt;French government demands&lt;/a&gt; details of interconnection agreements involving AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the most extreme cases, large Internet companies stop passing traffic to one another entirely. (This happened in 2005 with &lt;a href=&quot;http://morse.colorado.edu/~epperson/courses/routing-protocols/handouts/cogent-ft.html&quot;&gt;France Telecom and Cogent&lt;/a&gt;, in 2005 with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infoworld.com/t/networking/isp-spat-blacks-out-net-connections-492&quot;&gt;Cogent and Level 3&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2008 with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pcworld.com/article/153123/sprint_cogent_dispute.html&quot;&gt;Sprint and Cogent&lt;/a&gt;.) But recent disputes have been less likely to lead to a complete severing of ties. &quot;That type of reaction to a policy is becoming less common, possibly because it's so easy to publicize it,&quot; Reggie Forster, director of network engineering at XO Communications, told Ars. &quot;They tend to want to keep that quiet.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, network operators can degrade traffic by failing to upgrade connections without severing them entirely. The public won't realize that's what's going on unless negotiations become so contentious that one party makes them public—or a government decides to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Degraded connections disproportionately affect the quality of streaming video because video requires far more bits than most other types of traffic. Netflix and YouTube alone account for nearly half of all Internet traffic to homes in North America during peak hours, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sandvine.com/downloads/documents/Phenomena_1H_2013/Sandvine_Global_Internet_Phenomena_Report_1H_2013.pdf&quot;&gt;research by SandVine&lt;/a&gt;. And customers are far more likely to be annoyed by a video that stutters and stops than by a webpage taking a few extra seconds to load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;image center large full-width&quot; score=&quot;12.5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/sandvine-graph.png&quot; class=&quot;enlarge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/sandvine-graph-640x286.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot; score=&quot;17.5&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/sandvine-graph.png&quot; class=&quot;enlarge&quot;&gt;Enlarge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sep&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; North American traffic during peak hours.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get to the root of these problems, we need to take a step back and talk about the Internet itself. The very name &quot;Internet&quot; suggests many networks interconnecting, but few people know how the terms of these connections are negotiated. Understanding the business relationships that allow the Internet to exist in its present form is crucial to understanding the subtle and not-so-subtle ways Internet companies can bring your YouTube and Netflix videos to a slow stutter.&lt;/p&gt;
    		&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;hr class=&quot;rdb-page-break&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;article-content clearfix&quot; score=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The core of the Internet, the closest thing it has to a &quot;backbone,&quot; is a dozen or so networks consisting of data centers throughout the world. These networks, operated by private businesses, are called &quot;Tier 1&quot; because they can reach every part of the Internet simply by peering with one another. Two Tier 1 networks peer with each by configuring routers at multiple data centers to pass traffic back and forth. Peering is a point-to-point connection only, which doesn't necessarily guarantee passage of traffic to any networks beyond the two involved in the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Both providers have a large router, a Cisco or Juniper router, and they agree to interconnect them,&quot; Mark Taylor, VP of media and IP services at Level 3, told Ars. For example, he said, &quot;A 10Gbps port on one is connected to a 10Gbps port on another. The only traffic that can flow between those connections are between the respective customers of both parties.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tier 1 networks don't need to buy &quot;transit&quot;—an arrangement where one company pays another to accept its traffic and distribute it to all networks connected to the Internet. Smaller networks do, although even companies as big as Comcast buy transit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peering and transit are essential to Netflix and YouTube traffic. The Internet backbone providers that Netflix and Google pay to carry their traffic to the rest of the Internet need robust connections to other networks to ensure delivery of streaming videos to customers of all ISPs. Netflix and Google also offer to peer directly with ISPs to give videos a more direct path to customers' homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For more discussion of peering and transit, see Peter Bright's article &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/04/can-a-ddos-break-the-internet-sure-just-not-all-of-it/&quot;&gt;Can a DDoS break the Internet? Sure… just not all of it&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defining which networks are &quot;Tier 1&quot; isn't as simple as you might expect. The volunteer editors at Wikipedia have &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tier_1_network%23List_of_tier_1_networks&quot;&gt;listed Tier 1 networks&lt;/a&gt; as AT&amp;amp;T, CenturyLink, Deutsche Telekom, XO Communications, Telecom Italia, GTT, Verizon, Sprint, TeliaSonera International Carrier, NTT, Level 3, Tata Communications, and Zayo Group. The list is probably not complete. Wikipedia calls Cogent and Orange &quot;major networks&quot; but not Tier 1s, meaning they don't have to buy transit but do pay for peering. (Cogent denies this, telling Ars that it pays no other provider for interconnectivity.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether payment should disqualify a network from being labeled &quot;Tier 1&quot; is under dispute. A packet is routed across the Internet exactly the same way whether it is routed as the result of a free peering agreement or whether it is routed as part of a paid peering agreement, notes Martin Levy, director of IPv6 strategy at IP transit provider Hurricane Electric. Hurricane says it is a Tier 1 network for IPv6 traffic, though not for IPv4 traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason financial agreements are important isn't so much the semantic question of who is a Tier 1 network; it's that disagreements over whether payments should be made end up harming the quality of end-user connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Everybody always wants to get paid,&quot; Rudolf van der Berg, an economist and policy analyst for OECD, told Ars. &quot;If I had the choice between paying you, peering with you, or getting paid by you, I would choose getting paid by you. It doesn't necessarily mean the other party is interested in paying. And that's the problem here.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peering without payment—&quot;settlement-free&quot; peering—occurs quite often between networks of roughly equal size and negotiating power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The word peering generally is synonymous with settlement-free,&quot; Taylor said. &quot;There is an agreement by both parties that there is an equal benefit by each to connect to the two networks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical peering agreements between US-based Tier 1 networks involve connections in six to 10 locations across the US, mainly in major cities, Forster said. XO also peers with providers in London, Amsterdam, and Frankfurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A crucial part of peering agreements is upgrading connections when they start to fill, because congested ports slow down the rate at which bits flow between the networks. That's what happened when Verizon &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/06/verizon-bandwidth-provider-blame-each-other-for-slow-netflix-streaming/&quot;&gt;refused to add&lt;/a&gt; as many ports to its connections with Cogent as Cogent felt was necessary. Verizon FiOS Customers promptly &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.verizon.com/t5/FiOS-Internet/Netflix-is-slow-lately-on-FIOS/m-p/584177/highlight/true#M38639&quot;&gt;complained on Verizon support forums&lt;/a&gt; when their Netflix video playback got dramatically worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;image center full&quot; score=&quot;12.5&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/netflix-speed-rank.png&quot; width=&quot;419&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot; score=&quot;17.5&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Netflix speed by carrier.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Typically what happened is when the connections reached about 50 percent utilization, the two parties agreed to upgrade them and they would be upgraded in a timely manner,&quot; Cogent CEO Dave Schaeffer told Ars. &quot;Over the past year or so, as we have continued to pick up Netflix traffic, Verizon has continuously slowed down the rate of upgrading those connections, allowing the interconnections to become totally saturated and therefore degrading the quality of throughput.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schaeffer said this is true of all the big players to varying degrees, naming Comcast, Time Warner, CenturyLink, and AT&amp;amp;T. Out of those, he said that &quot;AT&amp;amp;T is the best behaved of the bunch.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Letting ports fill up can be a negotiating tactic. Verizon and Cogent each have to spend about $10,000 for equipment when a port is added, Schaeffer said—pocket change for companies of this size. But instead of the companies sharing equal costs, Verizon wants Cogent to pay because more traffic is flowing from Cogent to Verizon than vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;When the traffic loads are not symmetric, the provider with the heavier load typically pays the other for transit,&quot; Verizon said in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://publicpolicy.verizon.com/blog/entry/unbalanced-peering-and-the-real-story-behind-the-verizon-cogent-dispute&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. Cogent doesn't want to pay and says the traffic loads are unequal because Verizon customers are requesting so many Netflix videos. Negotiations are surely ongoing behind the scenes, but no agreement has been announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute is similar to the one that happened in late 2010, when Comcast demanded payment from Level 3 in order to carry Netflix traffic. The dispute didn't get to the point where ports were saturated. &quot;We, under protest, agreed to pay,&quot; Taylor told Ars. This month, nearly three years after the dispute began, the companies released a &lt;a href=&quot;http://level3.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=23600&amp;amp;item=136853&quot;&gt;joint statement&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;Level 3 and Comcast have resolved their prior interconnect dispute on mutually satisfactory terms. Details will not be released,&quot; it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The funny thing&quot; about these disputes is how little money is involved, van der Berg said. The French telecom regulator ARCEP &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arcep.fr/uploads/tx_gspublication/rapport-parlement-net-neutrality-sept2012-ENG.pdf&quot;&gt;has found&lt;/a&gt; that money changing hands between operators for peering and transit, plus the amount paid to third parties that host Internet exchange points, is equal to just 0.2 percent to 0.5 percent of revenue generated by the supply of Internet access to end users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One obvious question to ask is whether ISPs refusing to upgrade peering connections could violate net neutrality laws. The Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) &lt;a href=&quot;http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-10-201A1_Rcd.pdf&quot;&gt;Open Internet Order&lt;/a&gt; prevents ISPs from blocking content or unreasonably discriminating against third-party traffic. ISPs that sell their own video services while simultaneously degrading other video traffic might seem to be violating the principles of net neutrality, but they're likely not violating the letter of the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCC's Open Internet Order makes only one reference to peering: &quot;We do not intend our rules to affect existing arrangements for network interconnection, including existing paid peering arrangements.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Susan Crawford, a former tech policy advisor to President Obama and author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scrawford.net/the-book-captive-audience/&quot;&gt;Captive Audience: The Telecom Industry &amp;amp; Monopoly Power in the New Gilded&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scrawford.net/the-book-captive-audience/&quot;&gt; Age&lt;/a&gt;, told Ars via e-mail that this exception for network interconnection agreements including paid peering &quot;is an enormous problem. If we focus only on discrimination vis a vis users' access to applications, we're missing a huge part of the story. Network operators in the US are now sufficiently powerful that they can pinch traffic farther upstream as well as pinch traffic in the last mile.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's easy to see why more traffic flows from Cogent to Verizon than vice versa. Cogent is one of Netflix's Internet service providers—Netflix pays Cogent for transit, to carry its traffic to the rest of the Internet. Many Verizon customers, meanwhile, pay Netflix to stream video. Each time a Netflix customer using Verizon's network clicks on a Netflix video, that click sends just a tiny bit of traffic to Verizon and then on to Cogent and Netflix. In return, that customer receives a flood of data—&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.netflix.com/en/node/87&quot;&gt;up to 2.8GB&lt;/a&gt; for each hour of high-definition content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just how the last-mile ISPs want it, apparently, since they have made it difficult for customers to send as much traffic as they receive by &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/staff/2013/07/manifesto-let-my-upload-bandwidth-flow/&quot;&gt;providing far lower&lt;/a&gt; upload speeds than download speeds. Even customers who might try to achieve some upload/download parity—perhaps by using backup services to replicate all of their data—will find that hard to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trying to get paid on both ends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone involved in sending Netflix traffic to customers is getting compensated. Verizon and Netflix get paid by home Internet users, and Cogent is paid by Netflix. Verizon wants to get paid twice—by its own Internet customers and by Cogent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of whether Cogent should pay Verizon comes down in part to the question of who causes the traffic. Did Netflix &quot;cause&quot; the traffic by offering streaming content over the Internet? Or did Verizon cause the traffic by providing Internet service to customers who expect access to Netflix videos?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Verizon has chosen to sell its customers a product that they hope those customers don't actually use,&quot; Schaeffer said. &quot;And when customers use it and request movies, they have not ensured there is adequate connectivity to get that video content back to their customers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schaeffer accused Verizon of favoring its own services. &quot;Verizon is trying to incent customers to buy its video product, its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redboxinstant.com/&quot;&gt;Redbox product&lt;/a&gt;, as opposed to using competitive products of Netflix and others,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon might turn Schaeffer's arguments on their head, saying Netflix is selling a streaming video service without ensuring that the videos have a clear path to all customers. Verizon declined repeated interview requests from Ars, however, as did the majority of companies involved in these disputes. Comcast, Time Warner Cable, and CenturyLink did not answer questions or make anyone available for interviews. Google and Netflix both declined to say anything on the record. AT&amp;amp;T did not respond to e-mails. Three European players involved in disputes—Free, Orange, Deutsche Telekom—did not reply to e-mails. Telefónica responded that &quot;we can’t comment on regulatory cases that are ongoing except to say that Telefónica is cooperating fully.&quot; The FCC did not make anyone available for an interview or answer our questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since ISPs have argued that YouTube, Netflix, and other video services should pay for access to customers, they're actually seeking payment from three sources: their own customers, the online video providers, and Tier 1 networks like Cogent and Level 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked if ISPs are degrading Netflix and YouTube traffic to steer users toward their own video services, Crawford told Ars that &quot;the very powerful eyeball networks in the US (and particularly Comcast and Time Warner Cable) have ample incentive and ability to protect the IP services in which they have economic interests. Their real goal, however, is simpler and richer. They have enormous incentives to build a moat around their high-speed data networks and charge for entry because data is a very high-margin (north of 95 percent for the cable companies), addictive, utility product over which they have local monopoly control. They have told Wall Street they will do this. Yes, charging for entry serves the same purposes as discrimination in favor of their own VOD [video-on-demand], but it is a richer and blunter proposition for them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
    		&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;hr class=&quot;rdb-page-break&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;article-content clearfix&quot; score=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Netflix complaints by Verizon customers, Time Warner Cable customers recently complained about poor YouTube service. One &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/13kmvd/have_time_warner_internet_but_can_barely_stream/%22%3Eludicrously&quot;&gt;reddit thread&lt;/a&gt; shows how some technically inclined Time Warner customers used traffic analysis tools to identify the cause of YouTube problems. They were able to improve performance by blocking certain IP addresses, likely ones associated with slow YouTube content servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Warner Communications Director Jeff Simmermon wrote in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twcableuntangled.com/2013/06/explained-why-internet-traffic-slows-at-times/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; last month that a &quot;small subset of our customers... seem to think we are intentionally degrading their service. If I were to sum up these kinds of complaints, it would go something like this: 'Hulu and YouTube wouldn’t intentionally degrade their services and provide a subpar experience, but for some reason, it makes total sense that Time Warner Cable would by throttling customers’ traffic.'&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simmermon further noted that &quot;some, but not all, online video providers have the resources to store copies, or caches, of their videos on servers that are a part of a Content Delivery Network, or CDN. When a user clicks on a link to a particular video, the Internet provider can quickly determine where the nearest cached copy of the video is on the CDN and deliver it. More popular videos will have more cached copies, with better performance, while less popular videos may be stored in fewer, further places.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What he didn't comment on is whether Time Warner accepts Google's YouTube caches into its network. But as noted earlier, Time Warner has refused to accept Netflix's caching equipment. Netflix may still be hosting its own caches throughout the country, but if they're not in Time Warner data centers, Time Warner customers get worse performance than they otherwise might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europeans are suffering similar problems. &quot;There is a kind of hot/cold thing,&quot; said telecom watcher Benoît Felten, the CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.diffractionanalysis.com/who-we-are&quot;&gt;Diffraction Analysis&lt;/a&gt;. Felten lives in France and is a customer of Free, an ISP that has been accused of throttling YouTube, or at least under-investing in the connections that pass YouTube traffic to end users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Right now, YouTube doesn't work too bad on Free,&quot; Felten said earlier this month. &quot;Three weeks ago it was horrendous. A 30-second video, like an &lt;em&gt;Angry Birds&lt;/em&gt; solution video, would take 12 minutes before the first frame moved. Right now, you get some lags but it's acceptable. I suspect whatever they're doing, they're constantly shifting it so it doesn't look like it's constantly horrible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of intentional discrimination against YouTube, it may simply be that Free's network is short of capacity. A few days after Felten spoke with Ars, the French telecom regulator ARCEP announced that it &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arcep.fr/index.php?id=8571&amp;amp;tx_gsactualite_pi1%5Buid%5D=1619&amp;amp;tx_gsactualite_pi1%5Bannee%5D=&amp;amp;tx_gsactualite_pi1%5Btheme%5D=&amp;amp;tx_gsactualite_pi1%5Bmotscle%5D=&amp;amp;tx_gsactualite_pi1%5BbackID%5D=26&amp;amp;cHash=3e1f6c03d0b85ed8e34f7b594f46e957&quot;&gt;found no evidence&lt;/a&gt; of Free using discriminatory practices against YouTube, although it did say traffic &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zdnet.com/isp-free-cleared-of-throttling-youtube-in-france-7000018367/&quot;&gt;is congested&lt;/a&gt; during peak hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European market has far more competition for home Internet service than the US does. Felten says he is going to switch to a different Internet service and hopes many other Free customers will do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While European ISPs want payments from Google and Netflix, Felten said they should just focus on improving Internet service. &quot;Customers are already paying for it,&quot; he said. &quot;You sell a service to the end user which is you can access the Internet. You make a huge margin on that. Why should they get extra revenue for something that's already being paid for?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paid peering contracts with fixed prices also don't make sense, he said, because IP transit is &quot;constantly going down in price... At some point you'll be paying more for peering than you would for transit, which is absurd.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the absurdity of ISP proposals to charge video providers, Felten noted that &quot;when Orange purchased [video service] Dailymotion, that same week a white paper &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atkearney.com/documents/10192/4b98dac5-0c99-4439-9292-72bfcd7a6dd1&quot;&gt;released by A.T. Kearney&lt;/a&gt; that Orange had financed basically said, 'this is how much online service providers should pay per gigabit of traffic that is delivered through our networks.' I applied that calculation to Dailymotion's traffic, and basically they would have had to pay &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fiberevolution.com/2011/03/how-net-discrimination-works-or-doesnt-work.html&quot;&gt;twice their annual revenue in charges&lt;/a&gt; (nearly €42 million [roughly $55.5 million]). It's absurd. The whole economic model would break down if you were to apply that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New, improved way of measuring traffic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerned about ISPs demanding payment from fellow network peers, Level 3 has come up with a new way of measuring peers' impact on each other's networks. Traditionally, traffic loads have been thought to be &quot;in balance&quot; if each peer sends about as much traffic to the other peer as it receives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the direction in which traffic flows has no impact on how much it costs to carry it, Level 3 argues. Because video streaming traffic dominates the Web, so-called &quot;eyeball&quot; networks (ISPs who deliver traffic over the last mile) can never be in balance with the networks that deliver video under the old measurement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, Level 3 wants to measure via &quot;bit miles,&quot; the distance traffic is carried and the number of bits carried, regardless of which direction the traffic flows. So far, tw telecom and XO Communications have entered long-term, settlement-free peering agreements with Level 3 using bit mile measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a new idea. I think it's going to take a little bit to get more people on board,&quot; Forster said. &quot;It needs to be simplified. Right now, both us and Level 3 are working out kinks in how this works.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two networks could still end up with unbalanced traffic under the bit miles approach, but it would be easier to fix. &quot;If you connect in 10, 15, 20, 30 places, it's easy to add connectivity points, it's easy over time to add and subtract those connectivity points to make sure the networks are in balance and you incur equal costs of transmission,&quot; Taylor said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level 3 objects to most demands that peers pay each other, even if the amounts aren't huge. The amount of money &quot;for Level 3 is not material,&quot; Taylor said. &quot;It's the principle of who decides because it's a non-competitive market. We have no choice. There is one party that sets the rate; there is no competitive pressure we can bring to bear to negotiate that rate or get a different way into the network.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where a lack of competition in the home Internet market comes into play. When a consumer's second option is slow or non-existent, the dominant Internet provider can maintain a monopoly even while delivering poor service. According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2013/db0213/DOC-318810A1.pdf&quot;&gt;FCC data&lt;/a&gt;, 86 percent of American households have a choice of at least two wired Internet providers offering 3Mbps download speed and 768Kbps upload—but that's not even fast enough to qualify as broadband. Only 34 percent of US households have a choice of Internet providers offering at least 6Mbps down and 1.5Mbps up. The FCC &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/08/119-million-americans-lack-broadband-internet-fcc-reports/&quot;&gt;defines&lt;/a&gt; broadband as 4Mbps down and 1Mbps up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.netflix.com/en/node/306&quot;&gt;recommends 5Mbps for HD streams&lt;/a&gt;—and remember that a home Internet connection is often shared across multiple devices and people. Moreover, speeds promised by ISPs may guarantee a certain level of bandwidth between you and your ISP's network, but not between you and the rest of the Internet because of peering disputes and under-provisioned connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;image center large full-width&quot; score=&quot;12.5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/fcc-choice.png&quot; class=&quot;enlarge&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/fcc-choice-640x462.png&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot; score=&quot;17.5&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/fcc-choice.png&quot; class=&quot;enlarge&quot;&gt;Enlarge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sep&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; From the FCC report &quot;Internet Access Services: Status as of December 31, 2011,&quot; released in February 2013.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The argument that payments between network operators are required because streaming video throws traffic loads out of balance &quot;is a complete canard,&quot; Crawford said. She explains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the commercial Internet was born, the telcos exchanged traffic with each other using handshake peering arrangements for which the paradigm was &quot;ratio-based&quot; payments. Because phone traffic was basically 1:1, or often 1:1, upstream and downstream, the big actors peered with one another for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we have enormously powerful eyeball network operators who are still taking advantage of this peering paradigm. And so they say, &quot;my users are asking for more traffic than they're sending upstream.&quot; Using this rationale, the cable companies have moved from having to pay to get their users' traffic out onto the Internet (which is where they were when the Internet began) to demanding free peering, to, today, charging for interconnection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the use of the network, and the architecture of the network, is now completely different. Cable is asymmetric; it was built for passive downloads and does not favor uploads. Also, users are doing a lot of downloading of content. It's a user-driven Internet. So of course traffic volumes are greater downstream than upstream. That's what cable is selling. It should want to sell more; it should want to build capacity and connect freely with transit networks; and it would if there was any competition. But there isn't. So cable companies can draw up the drawbridge and charge with impunity, or refuse to add capacity to service interconnecting providers unless they're paid (which is the same thing).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Bergmayer, senior staff attorney at advocacy group &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.publicknowledge.org/&quot;&gt;Public Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;, said ISPs like Verizon can't credibly claim that their networks are overloaded by Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We've seen all the cable advocates and the NCTA (National Cable &amp;amp; Telecommunications Association) &lt;a href=&quot;https://secure.dslreports.com/shownews/Cable-Industry-Finally-Admits-Caps-Not-About-Congestion-122791&quot;&gt;back away&lt;/a&gt; from the claim that data caps are necessary to manage congestion,&quot; Bergmayer said. &quot;Networks really aren't saturated on the last mile like they have been trying to claim for years. Particularly with Verizon—with FiOS, it has huge capacity. Verizon has said again and again that it could upgrade to gigabit; it just doesn't think that consumers really want it. They're always bragging about how great their fiber network is. They can't have their cake and eat it, too, and not really have real capacity problems on the one hand except when it comes to hammering out these deals with the Internet content companies on the other hand.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While European authorities have been demanding data on peering agreements from Internet companies, Bergmayer said the FCC should do the same. &quot;Antitrust people should be aware of potential issues as well as the FCC, and the FCC should be taking steps to make sure it has the data it needs to determine whether it needs to be doing anything to begin with,&quot; Bergmayer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levy prefers that government stay out of it. &quot;Any time you get a regulator involved you're pretty much guaranteed for stuff to go downhill,&quot; he said, only half joking. &quot;What they don't really understand is that sometimes this is OK. Basically, people need to argue. This is a relationship. No one can actually afford for this stuff not to work. Trust me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some IP networks argue with each more than others, he acknowledged. At Hurricane Electric, &quot;We have an open peering policy, which means if someone asks us to peer we have a very limited requirement on them in order to accept them as a peer.&quot; Hurricane Electric has so far been conspicuously absent from any of the recent public disputes. &quot;We're boring,&quot; Levy said. &quot;By design, of course, because we're not like the people who are in these disputes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Felten holds out hope that ISPs will become less likely to war with each other as they embrace over-the-top content—meaning the delivery of streaming video to any customer, even those who don't subscribe to the ISP's Internet service. ISPs that sell video outside their own networks will become just like Netflix and need other Internet companies to accept their traffic, the argument goes. They won't be able to throttle third-party traffic if they're worried about those same third parties throttling their own, Felten said. &quot;If you do [over-the-top], you're not serving customers on your network only anymore, you're serving customers on everybody's network,&quot; Felten said. &quot;If everybody else's network throttles your traffic, you have no business case. It can't work.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Verizon is getting into over-the-top video through its Redbox venture, that's not the strategy most are taking (and it hasn't stopped Verizon from warring with Cogent over Netflix).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bergmayer is skeptical that Felten's theory will prove true in the US. &quot;I've been hoping for a while that these guys would realize they could enter the over-the-top market,&quot; Bergmayer said. &quot;But we've just seen things like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Everywhere&quot;&gt;TV Everywhere&lt;/a&gt; where it's essentially each ISP runs service just for its own customers and they sort of divide up the country like that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
    		&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;hr class=&quot;rdb-page-break&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;article-content clearfix&quot; score=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Not every problem with streaming video can be traced back to peering agreements or caching disputes. One video expert told Ars that there are many components of video playback that can&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;degrade quality, including the serving of advertisements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To load a pre-roll ad, &quot;You have a third-party library involved which may or may not have been dynamically loaded. You may have third-party calls, there could be calls to several ad networks, and then the retrieval of that ad content and then the actual playback of the ad. There are a surprising number of steps to get just that simple preroll ad to play,&quot; said Frank Paolino, a senior service line manager at Akamai, a content delivery company whose businesses include technology for commercial video services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube and Netflix pour lots of resources into upgrading streaming and video player technology to reduce performance lags. Last year, Google gave the YouTube player an overhaul that reportedly &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2012/09/23/building-faster-youtube/JqbVsEFUJfa5tpQmgbujkL/story.html&quot;&gt;reduced buffering&lt;/a&gt; by an average of 20 percent. Each little performance gain is arguably more crucial in video streaming than in the loading of most types of webpages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you go to a retailer's website and their page takes half second to load, that is probably not perceptible to the human eye,&quot; Mike Palladino, Internap’s director of IP architecture and operations, told Ars. &quot;If the graphics at the bottom take some time to load you probably don't notice that because you're looking at the stuff at the top that did load. Video and VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol traffic) really exacerbate the symptoms we're seeing where demand outstrips supply.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet is a complex beast, with each packet of data trying to get to its destination through the most direct route, rerouting if necessary when something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;image center full&quot; score=&quot;12.5&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot; score=&quot;17.5&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Visualization of the Internet, with lines drawn between nodes, each node representing an IP address.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When watching YouTube, &quot;my computer opens a data stream connection to a YouTube server that is going to serve me this content,&quot; Palladino said. &quot;That's one piece of it: establishing connectivity. The second piece is making sure there's a constant stream and I have good connectivity from start to finish. That's where we see things fall apart. If you're trying to watch an hour and a half video, the chances of you having zero connectivity issues from your host to that YouTube server for that length of time is almost zero. Network conditions fluctuate second to second, moment to moment. If someone takes a site down for maintenance in between, someone has a capacity issue on one of those interconnections,&quot; your video could stop or slow down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Take my cache, please&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's because of problems like this that the likes of Google and Netflix offer to place their own equipment inside the data centers of Internet Service Providers. If Comcast, Verizon, and AT&amp;amp;T had YouTube and Netflix videos sitting inside their own facilities, video streams would take many fewer hops to reach customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to &lt;a href=&quot;https://peering.google.com/about/peering_policy.html&quot;&gt;peering with network operators&lt;/a&gt;, Google has what it calls the &quot;Google Global Cache (GGC).&quot; This &quot;represents the final tier of Google’s content delivery platform and is closest to users,&quot; Google says in its &lt;a href=&quot;https://peering.google.com/about/ggc.html&quot;&gt;description of the service&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;With GGC, network operators and Internet Service Providers deploy a small number of Google servers inside their network to serve popular Google content including YouTube. Google's traffic management system directs users to the node that will provide the best performance for the user. GGC can be located anywhere in an operator's network to maximize savings in backbone and transit bandwidth. Targeted deployment can reduce the number of route-miles traveled on an operator's network to serve Google traffic, further increasing cost savings for the operator.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google does not reveal which ISPs accept the equipment into their data centers. It's clear many do not, since ISPs have argued that Google and Netflix should be paying them, even though the caches are offered for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix's similar peering and caching service is called Open Connect. ISPs can peer with Netflix at &lt;a href=&quot;https://signup.netflix.com/openconnect/faq&quot;&gt;up to eight Internet exchange points&lt;/a&gt; for free &quot;or can save even more transit costs by putting our free storage appliances in or near their network,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://signup.netflix.com/openconnect&quot;&gt;Netflix says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frontier, British Telecom, TDC, Clearwire, GVT, Telus, Bell Canada, Virgin, Cablevision, Google Fiber, Telmex, and RCN are among those who have done so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;To us, it's really a black box that's run by Netflix,&quot; RCN VP of network services Peter Jacoby told Ars. &quot;We do almost nothing except give it IP addresses. We put them in our data centers and that content gets a lot closer to our customers, so when they request a movie, typically the popular ones I'm told will stream from their closest cache and that eliminates a lot that can go wrong between them and Netflix.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this brings RCN additional costs in power, cooling, and colocation, it also reduces the amount of traffic RCN has to take from outside its own network. In addition, it gives subscribers more reliable streaming and access to &quot;Super HD&quot; and 3D content available only to customers of ISPs that use Netflix Open Connect. &quot;To us, that's a win,&quot; Jacoby said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Time Warner &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/01/timewarner-net-neutrality-foes-cry-foul-netflix-requirements-for-super-hd/&quot;&gt;refused to partner&lt;/a&gt; with Netflix, it accused the video service of &quot;closing off access to some of its content while seeking unprecedented preferential treatment from ISPs.&quot; Although Time Warner hasn't publicly demanded payment from Netflix, agreeing to settlement-free peering and caching would preclude Time Warner from demanding that Netflix pay to send traffic to Time Warner users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Felten warns that forcing companies like Netflix to pay all the last-mile ISPs to get their content to users would prevent future Netflixes from even existing. &quot;If by default a peering relationship has to be paid by the online service provider, then the next Facebook will never exist, and the next YouTube will never exist because from day one they will be straddled with a cost they will be unable to bear,&quot; Felten told Ars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For today, at least one thing is clear. If you want an Internet Service Provider that has no qualms about peering with competitors and accepting caching services offered by third-party video providers, the biggest ISPs aren't your best bets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RCN, which competes against the likes of Verizon and Comcast in Chicago, Boston, New York, Washington, DC, and parts of Pennsylvania, knows that demanding money from Netflix isn't going to fly. Being the smaller player, RCN has to distinguish itself by offering better service, Jacoby said. Even though RCN provides video-on-demand content of its own, with rental fees for premium videos, that doesn't stop the company from making sure its customers get good YouTube and Netflix quality as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We'll be in line with our hand out if Comcast is getting paid [by Netflix] and Time Warner is getting paid,&quot; Jacoby said. &quot;But there are network neutrality implications, there are a lot of questions I'd want to see answered before just going and shaking them down. What threat do we have? We're going to make service bad for our customers? We're not going to do that. Some of the other cable companies are willing to do that, but we're not going to. Being the little guy, that's the competitive position, and that's the differentiation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Sweden Runs Out of Garbage With Waste-to-Energy
</title>

</link>
<description>
&lt;div&gt;
			&lt;div class=&quot;post-content&quot;&gt;
				&lt;br class=&quot;clear&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pachamama.org/blog/models-of-sustainability-sweden-runs-out-of-garbage/recycle&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-26829&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.pachamama.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/recycle.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;recycle&quot; width=&quot;550&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-26829&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to Sweden&amp;#x2019;s innovative &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.avfallsverige.se/fileadmin/uploads/forbranning_eng.pdf&quot; target='_&quot;blank&quot;'&gt;waste-to-energy&lt;/a&gt; program and highly efficient recycling habits, the Scandinavian nation faces an interesting dilemma. They have run out of trash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweden&amp;#x2019;s waste management and recycling programs are second to none as only &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/12/sweden-imports-trash_n_1876746.html&quot; target='_&quot;blank&quot;'&gt;four percent&lt;/a&gt; of the nation&amp;#x2019;s waste ends up in landfills. By contrast, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, over half of the waste produced by U.S. households ends up in landfills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the Swedish manage waste so effectively and then use what remains to partly power their country, they are now living an environmentalist&amp;#x2019;s dream; a shortage of garbage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Circle Of Energy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to continue fueling the waste-to-energy factories that provide electricity to a quarter of a million homes and 20 percent of the entire country&amp;#x2019;s district heating, Sweden is now importing trash from the landfills of other European countries. In fact, those countries are paying Sweden to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You read that correctly, countries are paying to get rid of a source of fuel they themselves produced so that Sweden can continue to have the energy output they need. You don&amp;#x2019;t have to be an economist to know that&amp;#x2019;s one highly enviable energy model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the economic benefit, Sweden&amp;#x2019;s system of sustainability clearly has vast &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pachamama.org/advocacy/rights-of-nature&quot;&gt;environmental&lt;/a&gt; benefits. Aside from traditional recycling programs, their waste-to-energy system ensures minimal environmental impact from the country&amp;#x2019;s waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweden&amp;#x2019;s extremely efficient circle of consumption, waste management, and energy output provides the current global population and coming generations inspiration and guidance towards a more sustainable future. They represent one ally of many who understand the need to live sustainably and who fully commit to doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Commitment to a Sustainable Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Sweden, we at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pachamama.org/about&quot;&gt;The Pachamama Alliance&lt;/a&gt; are committed to creating a more sustainable future. Through our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pachamama.org/workshops/about&quot;&gt;inspiring and educational&lt;/a&gt; symposiums delivered all over the world, and our dedicated efforts to empower indigenous communities in the Amazon, we strive to catalyze sustainable models of energy production and waste management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our help, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pachamama.org/achuar&quot;&gt;indigenous&lt;/a&gt; Achuar community in Ecuador continue to establish sustainable development alternatives, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pachamama.org/appropriate-technology#canoes&quot;&gt;solar powered canoes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pachamama.org/appropriate-technology#pump&quot;&gt;water pumps.&lt;/a&gt; They have also improved waste management through innovations like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pachamama.org/appropriate-technology#toilet&quot;&gt;compostable toilets,&lt;/a&gt; which improve sanitation and reduce ground and water pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taking a Stand Together&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As climate change continues to worsen, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pachamama.org/about&quot;&gt;The Pachamama Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and our community of allies stand firmly opposed to the destructive trends of unsustainable systems that burden the Earth so heavily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indigenous communities like the Achuar who are committed to finding environmentally sound ways of addressing their energy needs, and countries like Sweden who represent a modern &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pachamama.org/advocacy/sustainable-development&quot;&gt;commitment to sustainability,&lt;/a&gt; offer models of solutions that work for a thriving planetary future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, any person or community that takes a stand to protect the ailing environment is taking a stand for you. They are standing up for all future generations of Life that will inherit this planet. How will you take your stand?&lt;/p&gt;

Sleepwalking into censorship

<description>
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;sixteen columns&quot;&gt;	



  &lt;p class=&quot;info&quot;&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;date&quot; datetime=&quot;2013-07-25T16:47:00Z&quot;&gt;July 25, 2013&lt;/span&gt; | Jim Killock&lt;/p&gt;
 
  
  

	
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;After brief conversations with some of the Internet Service Providers that will be implementing the UK's &quot;pornwall&quot; we've established a little bit about what it will be doing. To be fair, the BBC were pretty close.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The essential detail is that they will assume you want filters enabled across a wide range of content, and unless you un-tick the option, network filters will be enabled. As we&amp;#x2019;ve said repeatedly, it&amp;#x2019;s not just about hardcore pornography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll encounter something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(1) Screen one&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Parental controls&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do you want to install / enable parental controls&lt;br&gt;[ticked box] yes&lt;br&gt;[unticked box] no&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[next]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(2) Screen two [if you have left the box ticked]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#x201C;Parental controls&amp;#x201D;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you want to block&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ticked box] pornography&lt;br&gt;[ticked box] violent material&lt;br&gt;[ticked box] extremist and terrorist related content&lt;br&gt;[ticked box] anorexia and eating disorder websites&lt;br&gt;[ticked box] suicide related websites&lt;br&gt;[ticked box] alcohol&lt;br&gt;[ticked box] smoking&lt;br&gt;[ticked box] web forums&lt;br&gt;[ticked box] esoteric material&lt;br&gt;[ticked box] web blocking circumvention tools&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can opt back in at any time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[continue]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The precise pre-ticked options may vary from service to service.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's clear here is that David Cameron wants people to sleepwalk&amp;#xA0;into censorship. We know that people stick with defaults: this is part of the idea behind '&lt;a title=&quot;Wikipedia nudge theory&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory&quot;&gt;nudge theory&lt;/a&gt;' and 'choice architecture' that is popular with Cameron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implication is that filtering is good, or at least harmless, for anyone, whether adult or child. Of course, this is not true; there's not just the question of false positives for web users, but the affect on a network economy of excluding a proportion of a legitimate website's audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There comes a point that it is simply better to place your sales through Amazon and ebay, and circulate your news and promotions exclusively through Facebook and Twitter, as you know none of these will ever be filtered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile ISPs face the unenviable customer relations threat of increased complaints as customers who hadn't paid much attention find websites unexpectedly blocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as bad, filters installed with no thought cannot be expected to set appropriately for children of different ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Of course, all of this could be easily avoided by simply having an 'active choice' as the ISPs originally suggested: with no preset defaults, forcing customers to specify whether they wanted filters, or not.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's really very surprising that Cameron's campaign has spent six months insisting on a system designed to fail consumers, threatening ISPs with legislation if they didn't use the inaccurate, error prone method that Number 10 seem to believe in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it all seems to work badly, at what point is it ok for ISPs to start running their own businesses, and change the setup screens?&lt;/p&gt;

Did Goldman Overstep in Criminally Charging Its Ex-Programmer?
</title>
<link>
http://www.vanityfair.com/business/2013/09/michael-lewis-goldman-sachs-programmer
</link>
<description>
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A month after ace programmer Sergey Aleynikov left Goldman Sachs, he was arrested. Exactly what he&amp;#x2019;d done neither the F.B.I., which interrogated him, nor the jury, which convicted him a year later, seemed to understand. But Goldman had accused him of stealing computer code, and the 41-year-old father of three was sentenced to eight years in federal prison. Investigating Aleynikov&amp;#x2019;s case, Michael Lewis holds a second trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vanityfair.com/contributors/michael-lewis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Read more of Michael Lewis&amp;#x2019;s pieces for&lt;/i&gt; Vanity Fair&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dc&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;o Sergey Aleynikov&amp;#x2019;s new way of thinking, every American could benefit from some time in jail, but in the event that you are yourself actually arrested and sent away, &amp;#x201C;there are certain practical aspects to keep in mind.&amp;#x201D; First, dress warmly. Detention centers tend to be freezing cold, even in summer, and so if you happen to be wearing shorts or short sleeves you&amp;#x2019;re in for a spectacularly unhappy night. Second, carry no cash. &amp;#x201C;If you have money, they charge you a convenience fee,&amp;#x201D; he explains. &amp;#x201C;If you don&amp;#x2019;t have it, they don&amp;#x2019;t charge you. The less money you have on you, the better.&amp;#x201D; Third, memorize a couple of emergency contact phone numbers. On the night of his first arrest he discovered he didn&amp;#x2019;t actually know his wife&amp;#x2019;s cell-phone number. He&amp;#x2019;d always phoned her by name from his cell phone&amp;#x2019;s address book, but his phone was one of the first things they&amp;#x2019;d taken from him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The fourth, and final, rule was by far the most important: Don&amp;#x2019;t say a word to government officials. &amp;#x201C;The reason you don&amp;#x2019;t,&amp;#x201D; he says, &amp;#x201C;is that, if you do, they can place an agent on a witness stand and he can say anything.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the night of July 3, 2009, as he came off a flight from Chicago to Newark, New Jersey, he was totally unprepared, because he&amp;#x2019;d never imagined himself as the sort of person who might commit a crime. He worked too much and took only the vaguest interest in his fellow human beings, but, up to the moment of his arrest, Aleynikov had no sense that there was anything wrong with him or his situation. On the surface, his life had never been better: his third child had just been born, he had a new job at a hedge fund that paid him a million dollars a year, and he&amp;#x2019;d just moved into a big new house of his own design that he thought of as the perfect home. He&amp;#x2019;d come to America 20 years ago with little English and less money. Now he was living the dream.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For much of the flight from Chicago he&amp;#x2019;d slept. Leaving the plane he had noticed three men in dark suits, waiting in the alcove of the Jetway reserved for baby strollers and wheelchairs. They confirmed his identity, explained they were from the F.B.I., handcuffed him, and walled him off from the other passengers. This last act was no great feat. Serge was six feet tall but weighed roughly 130 pounds: to hide him you needed only to turn him sideways. He resisted none of these actions, but he was genuinely bewildered. The men in black refused to tell him his crime. He tried to figure it out. His first guess was that they&amp;#x2019;d gotten him mixed up with some other Sergey Aleynikov. Then it occurred to him that his new employer, the legendary high-frequency trader Misha Malyshev, might have done something shady. Wrong on both counts. It wasn&amp;#x2019;t until the plane had emptied and they&amp;#x2019;d escorted him into Newark Airport that they told him his crime: stealing computer code owned by Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The agent in charge of the case, Michael McSwain, was fairly new to law enforcement. Oddly enough, he&amp;#x2019;d been a currency trader on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for 12 years. He&amp;#x2019;d ended his career on Wall Street the same year, 2007, that Serge was beginning his. McSwain marched Serge into a black town car and drove him to the F.B.I. building in Lower Manhattan. After making a show of stashing his gun outside, Serge says, McSwain led him into a tiny interrogation room, handcuffed him to a rod on the wall, and, finally, read him his Miranda rights.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then he explained what he knew, or thought he knew: in April 2009, Serge had accepted a job at a new high-frequency-trading shop called Teza Technologies, but had remained at Goldman for the next six weeks, until June 5, during which time he sent himself, through a so-called &amp;#x201C;subversion repository,&amp;#x201D; 32 megabytes of source code from Goldman&amp;#x2019;s high-frequency stock-trading system. The Web site Serge had used (which has the word &amp;#x201C;subversion&amp;#x201D; in its name) as well as the location of its server (Germany) McSwain clearly found highly suspicious. He also seemed to think it significant that Serge had used a site not blocked by Goldman Sachs, even after Serge tried to explain to him that Goldman did not block any sites used by its programmers, but merely blocked its employees from porn and social-media sites and suchlike. Finally, the F.B.I. agent wanted him to admit that he had erased his &amp;#x201C;bash history&amp;#x201D;&amp;#x2014;that is, the commands he had typed into his own Goldman computer keyboard. Serge tried to explain why he had done this, but McSwain had no interest in his story. &amp;#x201C;The way he did it seemed nefarious,&amp;#x201D; the F.B.I. agent would later testify.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dc&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;ll of which was true, as far as it went, but, to Serge, that didn&amp;#x2019;t seem very far. &amp;#x201C;I thought it was like, crazy, really,&amp;#x201D; he says. &amp;#x201C;He was stringing these computer terms together in ways that made no sense. He didn&amp;#x2019;t seem to know anything about high-frequency trading or source code.&amp;#x201D; For instance, Serge had no idea where the &amp;#x201C;subversion repository&amp;#x201D; was physically located. It was just a place on the Internet used by developers to store the code they were working on. &amp;#x201C;The whole point of the Internet is to abstract the physical location of the server from its logical address.&amp;#x201D; To Serge, McSwain sounded like a man repeating phrases that he&amp;#x2019;d heard from others but that, to him, actually meant nothing. &amp;#x201C;There is a game in Russia called &amp;#x2018;Phone Book&amp;#x2019; &amp;#x201D; (like the American game Telephone), he says. &amp;#x201C;It felt like he was playing that.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What Serge did not yet know was that Goldman had discovered his downloads just a few days earlier, months after he&amp;#x2019;d made the first of them. They&amp;#x2019;d called the F.B.I. in haste, just two days before, and then put their agent through what amounted to a crash course on high-frequency trading and computer programming. McSwain later conceded that he didn&amp;#x2019;t seek out independent expert advice to study the code Serge Aleynikov had taken. (&amp;#x201C;I relied on statements from Goldman employees.&amp;#x201D;) He himself had no idea of the value of the stolen code (&amp;#x201C;Representatives of Goldman told me it was worth a lot of money&amp;#x201D;) or if any of it was actually all that special (he based his belief that the code contained trade secrets on &amp;#x201C;representations made by members of Goldman Sachs&amp;#x201D;). The agent noted that the Goldman files were on both the personal computer and the thumb drive he&amp;#x2019;d taken from Serge at Newark Airport. (But virtually none of those files had been opened. If they were so important, why hadn&amp;#x2019;t Serge looked at them in the month since he&amp;#x2019;d left Goldman?) The F.B.I.&amp;#x2019;s investigation before the arrest consisted of trusting Goldman&amp;#x2019;s explanation of some extremely complicated stuff, and 48 hours after Goldman called the F.B.I., Serge was arrested.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dc&quot;&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;n the night of the arrest&amp;#x2014;without an arrest warrant&amp;#x2014;Serge waived his right to call a lawyer. He phoned his wife and told her what had happened and that a bunch of F.B.I. agents were on the way to their home to seize their computers, and to please let them in&amp;#x2014;though they had no search warrant, either. Then he sat down and politely tried to clear up the F.B.I. agent&amp;#x2019;s confusion. &amp;#x201C;How could [the agent] figure out if this was a theft if he didn&amp;#x2019;t understand what was taken?&amp;#x201D; Serge recalls having asked himself. What he&amp;#x2019;d done, in his view, was trivial; what he stood accused of&amp;#x2014;violating both the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 and the National Stolen Property Act&amp;#x2014;did not sound trivial at all. Still, he thought, if the agent understood how computers and the high-frequency-trading business actually worked, the matter would be quickly cleared up. &amp;#x201C;The reason I was explaining it to him was to show that there was nothing there,&amp;#x201D; Serge says. &amp;#x201C;He was completely not interested in the content of what I am saying. He just kept saying to me, &amp;#x2018;If you tell me everything, I&amp;#x2019;ll talk to the judge, and he&amp;#x2019;ll go easy on you.&amp;#x2019; It appeared they had a very strong bias from the very beginning. They had goals they wanted to fulfill. The goal was to obtain an immediate confession.&amp;#x201D; (The F.B.I. declined to comment on Aleynikov&amp;#x2019;s case.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Serge, the chief obstacle to the F.B.I.&amp;#x2019;s ability to extract his confession, oddly, wasn&amp;#x2019;t his willingness to provide it but ignorance of what Serge was attempting to confess. &amp;#x201C;In the written statement he was making some very obvious mistakes, computer terms and so on,&amp;#x201D; recalls Serge. &amp;#x201C;I was saying, You know, this is not correct.&amp;#x201D; Serge patiently walked the agent through his actions until finally, at 1:43 in the morning, after five hours of discussion, McSwain sent a giddy one-line e-mail to the U.S. Attorney&amp;#x2019;s Office: &amp;#x201C;Holy crap he signed a confession.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two minutes later he dispatched Serge to a cell in the Metropolitan Detention Center. The prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Facciponti, argued that Serge Aleynikov should be denied bail, for he was a danger to the community and a flight risk, as he had in his possession computer code which in the wrong hands could be used &amp;#x201C;to manipulate markets in unfair ways.&amp;#x201D; (Goldman Sachs presumably used it to manipulate markets in fair ways.) The confession Serge had signed, scarred by phrases crossed-out and re-written by the F.B.I. agent, later would be presented by prosecutors to a jury as the work of a thief who was being cautious, even tricky, with his words. &amp;#x201C;That&amp;#x2019;s not what happened,&amp;#x201D; says Serge. &amp;#x201C;The document was being crafted by someone with no previous expertise in the matter.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Serge Alyenikov&amp;#x2019;s signed confession was the last anyone heard from him, at least directly. He declined to speak to reporters or testify at his trial. He has a halting manner, a funny accent, a beard, and a physique that looks as if it had been painted by El Greco: in a lineup of people chosen randomly from the streets, he is the guy most likely to be identified as a Russian spy, or a character from an episode of the original &lt;i&gt;Star Trek.&lt;/i&gt; In technical discussions he has a tendency to speak with extreme precision, which is great when he is dealing with fellow experts but mind-numbing to a lay audience. In the court of U.S. public opinion, he wasn&amp;#x2019;t well suited to defend himself, and so, on the advice of his attorney, Kevin Marino, he didn&amp;#x2019;t. He kept his long silence even after he was sentenced, without the possibility of parole, to eight years in a federal prison.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Red Square&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dc&quot;&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;erge Aleynikov wasn&amp;#x2019;t the world&amp;#x2019;s most eager immigrant to America, or, for that matter, to Wall Street. He&amp;#x2019;d left Russia in 1991, two years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, but more in sadness than in hope. &amp;#x201C;When I was 19, I haven&amp;#x2019;t imagined leaving it,&amp;#x201D; he says. &amp;#x201C;I was very patriotic about Russia. I cried when Brezhnev died. And I always hated English. I thought I was completely incapable of learning languages.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His problem with Russia was that its government wouldn&amp;#x2019;t allow him to study what he wanted to study. He wasn&amp;#x2019;t religious in any conventional sense, but he&amp;#x2019;d been born a Jew, which had been noted on his Russian passport to remind everyone of the fact. As a Jew he expected to be given especially difficult entrance exams to university, which, if he passed them, would grant him access to just one of two Moscow universities that were more accepting of Jews. He&amp;#x2019;d been willing to tolerate this state of affairs; however, as it happened, he&amp;#x2019;d also been born to program computers. He hadn&amp;#x2019;t laid hands on one until 1986, when he was already 16, but the first thing he&amp;#x2019;d done was to write a program. He&amp;#x2019;d instructed the computer to draw a picture of a sine wave. When the computer actually followed his instructions, he was hooked. What hooked him, he now says, was &amp;#x201C;its detailed orientation. The way it requires an ability to see the problem and tackle it from different angles. It&amp;#x2019;s not just like chess, but like solving a particular problem in chess. The more challenging problem is not to play chess but to write the code that will play chess.&amp;#x201D; He found that coding engaged him not just intellectually but also emotionally. &amp;#x201C;Writing a program is like giving birth to a child,&amp;#x201D; he says. &amp;#x201C;It is a creation. Even though it is technical, it is a work of art. You get this level of satisfaction.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He applied to switch his major from mathematics to computer science, but the authorities forbade it. &amp;#x201C;That is what tipped me to accept the idea that perhaps Russia is not the best place for me,&amp;#x201D; he says. &amp;#x201C;When they wouldn&amp;#x2019;t allow me to study computer science.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dc&quot;&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;e arrived in New York City in 1991 and moved into a room at the 92nd Street Young Men&amp;#x2019;s and Young Women&amp;#x2019;s Hebrew Association, a sort of Jewish Y.M.C.A. Two things shocked him about his new city: the diversity of the people on the streets and the fantastic range of foods in the grocery stores. He took photographs of the rows and rows of sausages for sale and mailed them to his mother in Moscow. &amp;#x201C;I&amp;#x2019;d never seen so many sausages,&amp;#x201D; he says. But once he&amp;#x2019;d marveled at the American cornucopia, he stepped back from it all and wondered just how necessary all of this food was. He read books about fasting and the effects of various highly restrictive diets. &amp;#x201C;I decided to look at it a little bit further and ask what is beneficial and what is not,&amp;#x201D; he recalls. In the end he became a finicky vegetarian. &amp;#x201C;I don&amp;#x2019;t think all the energy you gain comes from food,&amp;#x201D; he says. &amp;#x201C;I think it comes from your environment.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He had arrived in America with no money at all, and no real idea how to get it. He took a course at the 92nd Street Y on how to apply for a job. &amp;#x201C;It was quite frightening,&amp;#x201D; he says. &amp;#x201C;I didn&amp;#x2019;t speak English, really, and a r&amp;#xE9;sum&amp;#xE9; was a totally alien concept.&amp;#x201D; His first interviewer asked him to tell him about himself. &amp;#x201C;To a Russian mentality, that question means &amp;#x2018;Where are you born?&amp;#x2019; &amp;#x2018;Who are your siblings?&amp;#x2019; &amp;#x201D; Serge described for the man at great length his family tree&amp;#x2014;and nothing else. &amp;#x201C;He tells me I will hear from him again. I never do.&amp;#x201D; But he had an obvious talent with computers and soon found a job operating them, for $8.75 an hour, in a New Jersey medical center. From the medical center he landed a better job in the Rutgers computer-science department, where they gave him a scholarship to pursue a master&amp;#x2019;s degree. After Rutgers he spent a few years working at Internet start-ups until, in 1998, he received a job offer from a big New Jersey telecom company called IDT. For the next decade he designed computer systems and wrote the code to route millions of phone calls each day to the cheapest available phone lines. When he joined the company it had 500 employees; by 2006 it had 5,000, and he was its star technologist. That year a headhunter called him and told him there was a booming demand for his particular skill&amp;#x2014;building software that parsed huge amounts of information at great speed&amp;#x2014;on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Serge knew nothing about Wall Street. The headhunter sent him a bunch of books about writing software on Wall Street, plus a primer on how to make it through a Wall Street job interview, and told him he could make a lot more than the $220,000 a year he was making at the telecom. Serge felt flattered, and liked the headhunter, but he read the books and decided Wall Street wasn&amp;#x2019;t for him. He enjoyed the technical challenges at the giant telecom and didn&amp;#x2019;t really feel the need to earn more money. A year later the headhunter called him again. By 2007, IDT was in financial trouble. His wife, Elina, was carrying their third child, and they would need to buy a bigger house. Serge agreed to interview with the Wall Street firm that especially wanted to meet him: Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dc&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;t that moment, at least on the surface, he had the sort of life people are said to come to America for. He&amp;#x2019;d married a pretty fellow Russian immigrant, and started a family with her. They bought a two-bedroom red-brick house in Clifton, New Jersey, then traded up to a three-bedroom Cape-style house in Little Falls. They had a circle of Russians they called their friends. On the other hand, all Serge did was work, and his wife had no real clue what that work involved; they weren&amp;#x2019;t actually all that close to each other. He didn&amp;#x2019;t encourage people to get to know him well, nor did he exhibit a great deal of interest in getting to know them. He was acquiring a lot of possessions in which he had very little interest. The lawn in Clifton was a fair example of the general problem. When he&amp;#x2019;d gone hunting for his first house he&amp;#x2019;d been enamored of the idea of having his very own lawn. In Moscow such a thing was unheard of. But the moment he had one, he regretted it. (&amp;#x201C;A pain in the butt to mow.&amp;#x201D;) A Russian writer named Masha Leder, who knew the Aleynikovs as well as anyone, thought Serge an exceptionally intellectually gifted but otherwise typical Russian computer programmer, for whom technical problems became an excuse not to deal with the messy world around him. &amp;#x201C;All of Serge&amp;#x2019;s life before he got into prison was some kind of mirage,&amp;#x201D; she says. &amp;#x201C;Or a dream. He was not aware of things. He liked slender girls who loved to dance. He married a girl and manages to have three kids with her before he figures out he doesn&amp;#x2019;t really know her. He was working his ass off, and she would spend the money he was making. He would come home, and she would cook him vegetarian dishes. He was serviced, basically.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then Wall Street called. Goldman Sachs put Serge through a series of telephone interviews, then brought him in for a long day of face-to-face interviews. These he found extremely tense, even a bit weird. &amp;#x201C;I was not used to seeing people put so much energy into evaluating other people,&amp;#x201D; he said. One after another, a dozen Goldman employees tried to stump him with brainteasers, computer puzzles, math problems, and even some light physics. It must have become clear to Goldman (as it was to Serge) that he knew more about most of the things he was being asked than did his interviewers. At the end of the first day, Goldman invited him back for a second day. He went home and thought it over: he wasn&amp;#x2019;t all that sure he wanted to work at Goldman Sachs. &amp;#x201C;But the next morning I had a competitive feeling,&amp;#x201D; he says. &amp;#x201C;I should conclude it and try to pass it because it&amp;#x2019;s a big challenge.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He&amp;#x2019;d been surprised to find that in at least one way he fit in: more than half the programmers at Goldman were Russians. Russians had a reputation for being the best programmers on Wall Street, and Serge thought he knew why: they had been forced to learn programming without the luxury of endless computer time. &amp;#x201C;In Russia, time on the computer was measured in minutes,&amp;#x201D; he says. &amp;#x201C;When you write a program, you are given a tiny time slot to make it work. Consequently we learned to write the code in a way that minimized the amount of debugging. And so you had to think about it a lot before you committed it to paper. . . . The ready availability of computer time creates this mode of working where you just have an idea and type it and maybe erase it 10 times. Good Russian programmers, they tend to have had that one experience at some time in the past: the experience of limited access to computer time.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He returned for another round of Goldman&amp;#x2019;s grilling, which ended in the office of one of the high-frequency traders, another Russian, named Alexander Davidovich. A managing director, he had just two final questions for Serge, both designed to test his ability to solve problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first: Is 3,599 a prime number?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Serge quickly saw there was something strange about 3,599: it was very close to 3,600. He jotted down the following equations: 3599 = (3600 &amp;#x2013; 1) = (60&lt;sup&gt;2 &lt;/sup&gt;&amp;#x2013; 1&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = (60 &amp;#x2013; 1) (60 + 1) = 59 times 61. Not a prime number.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The problem wasn&amp;#x2019;t that difficult, but, as he put it, &amp;#x201C;it was harder to solve the problem when you are anticipated to solve it quickly.&amp;#x201D; It might have taken him as long as two minutes to finish. The second question the Goldman managing director asked him was more involved&amp;#x2014;and involving. He described for Serge a room, a rectangular box, and gave him its three dimensions. &amp;#x201C;He says there is a spider on the floor and gives me its coordinates. There is also a fly on the ceiling, and he gives me its coordinates as well. Then he asked the question: Calculate the shortest distance the spider can take to reach the fly.&amp;#x201D; The spider can&amp;#x2019;t fly or swing; it can only walk on surfaces. The shortest path between two points was a straight line, and so, Serge figured, it was a matter of unfolding the box, turning a three-dimensional object into a one-dimensional surface, then using the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the distances. It took him several minutes to work it all out; when he was done, Davidovich offered him a job at Goldman Sachs. His starting salary plus bonus came to $270,000.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Full Speed Ahead&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dc&quot;&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;e&amp;#x2019;d joined Goldman at an interesting moment in the history of both the firm and Wall Street. By mid-2007, Goldman&amp;#x2019;s bond-trading department was aiding and abetting a global financial crisis, most infamously by helping the Greek government to rig its books and disguise its debt, and by designing subprime-mortgage securities to fail, so they might make money by betting against them. At the same time, Goldman&amp;#x2019;s equities department was adapting to radical changes in the U.S. stock market&amp;#x2014;just as that market was about to crash. A once sleepy oligopoly dominated by NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange was rapidly turning into something else. There were now 10 public stock exchanges in New Jersey alone, all trading the same stocks. Within a few years there would be more than 40 &amp;#x201C;dark pools,&amp;#x201D; or private exchanges, one of them owned by Goldman Sachs, also trading the same stocks. (Why the world needed 50 places, most of them in New Jersey, in which to buy and sell shares in Apple Inc. is a question for another day.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The fragmentation of the American stock market was fueled, in part, by a rule created in 2007 by the S.E.C. The rule, known inelegantly as Reg NMS, was designed to protect investors from their brokers. Instead it wound up creating, as such rules often do, new ways for brokers to abuse their clients. Reg NMS requires stockbrokers to route their clients&amp;#x2019; orders to whichever exchange offers the best price. For example: if you tell your Goldman Sachs broker to buy a million shares of Apple, and Apple shares are being offered at $400 a share on NASDAQ and $401 inside the Goldman Sachs dark pool, Goldman is now required to send your order first to NASDAQ. (You might think that brokers might do this naturally to please their clients. Think again.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For reasons not entirely obvious (yet another question for another day), the new rule stimulated a huge amount of stock-market trading. Much of the new volume was generated not by old-fashioned investors but by extremely fast computers controlled by high-frequency-trading firms, like Getco and Citadel and D. E. Shaw and Renaissance Capital, and the high-frequency-trading divisions of big Wall Street firms, especially Goldman Sachs. Essentially, the more places there were to trade stocks, the greater the opportunity there was for high-frequency traders to interpose themselves between buyers on one exchange and sellers on another. This was perverse. The initial promise of computer technology was to remove the intermediary from the financial market, or at least reduce the amount he could scalp from that market. The reality has turned out to be a boom in financial intermediation and an estimated take for Wall Street of somewhere between $10 and $20 billion a year, depending on whose estimates you wish to believe. As high-frequency-trading firms aren&amp;#x2019;t required to disclose their profits (with the exception of public firms, like Knight, which have disclosed profits in the past), and big banks like Goldman that engage in the practice are assumed to hide their own profits on their balance sheets, no one really knows just how much money is being made. But when a single high-frequency trader is paid $75 million in cash for a single year of trading (as was Misha Malyshev in 2008, when he worked at Citadel) and then quits because he is &amp;#x201C;dissatisfied,&amp;#x201D; a new beast is afoot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dc&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he combination of new market rules and new technology was turning the stock market into, in effect, a war of robots. The robots were absurdly fast: they could execute tens of thousands of stock-market transactions in the time it took a human trader to blink his eye. The games they played were often complicated, but one aspect of them was simple and clear: the faster the robot, the more likely it was to make money at the expense of the relative sloth of others in the market. There was easy money to be made, for instance, from being able to respond more quickly than the rest of the market to changes in the supply and demand for a given stock. There was not-so-easy money to be made running crude strategies premised on the correlation between different securities. For example, assume the stock prices of Coke and Pepsi tend to move together; if you can see Coke&amp;#x2019;s stock popping higher and Pepsi has not yet responded, your robot might buy Pepsi before anyone else has processed what&amp;#x2019;s happened to Coke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At any rate, in 2008, from the point of view of Goldman Sachs, the good news was that there were billions of new dollars to be made by stock-market intermediaries. The bad news was that Goldman Sachs wasn&amp;#x2019;t yet making much of it&amp;#x2014;or it was doing a very good job of disguising its profits. At the end of that year they informed their high-frequency-trading computer programmers that their trading unit had netted roughly $300 million. That same year the high-frequency-trading division of a single hedge fund, Citadel, made $1.2 billion. A headhunter who sat in the middle of the market, and saw what firms were paying for geek talent, says that &amp;#x201C;Goldman had started to figure it out, but they really hadn&amp;#x2019;t figured it out. They weren&amp;#x2019;t Top 10.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simple reason for this was that Goldman&amp;#x2019;s robots were slow. A lot of the moneymaking strategies were of the winner-take-all variety. When every player is trying to buy Pepsi after Coke&amp;#x2019;s stock has popped, the player whose computers can take in data and spit out the obvious response to it first gets all the money. In the various races being run, Goldman was seldom first. That is why they had sought out Serge Aleynikov: to improve the speed of their system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dc&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;here were many problems with Goldman&amp;#x2019;s system, in Serge&amp;#x2019;s view. It wasn&amp;#x2019;t so much a system as an amalgamation. &amp;#x201C;The code-development practices in IDT were much more organized and up-to-date than at Goldman,&amp;#x201D; he says. Goldman had bought the core of its system nine years earlier in the acquisition of one of the early electronic-trading firms, called Hull Trading. The massive amounts of old software (Serge guessed that the entire platform had as many as 60 million lines of code in it) and nine years of fixes to it had created the computer equivalent of a giant rubber-band ball. When one of the rubber bands popped, Serge was expected to find it and fix it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One small example of the kind of problems Serge found: Goldman&amp;#x2019;s trading on the NASDAQ exchange. Goldman owned the lone (unmarked) building directly across the street from NASDAQ in Carteret, New Jersey. The building housed Goldman&amp;#x2019;s dark pool. When Serge arrived, 40,000 messages per second were flying back and forth between computers inside the two buildings. Proximity, he assumed, must offer Goldman Sachs some advantage&amp;#x2014;after all, why else buy the only building anywhere near the exchange? But when he looked into it he found that, to cross the street from Goldman to NASDAQ, a signal took five milliseconds, or nearly as much time as it took a signal to travel on the fastest network from Chicago to New York. &amp;#x201C;The theoretical limit [of sending a signal] from Chicago to New York is something like seven milliseconds,&amp;#x201D; says Serge. &amp;#x201C;Everything more than that is the friction caused by man.&amp;#x201D; The friction could be caused by physical distance&amp;#x2014;say, if the signal moving across the street in Carteret, New Jersey, traveled in something less direct than a straight line. It could be caused by computer hardware. (The top high-frequency-trading firms chuck out their old gear and buy new stuff every few months.) But it could also be caused by slow, clunky software&amp;#x2014;and that was Goldman&amp;#x2019;s problem. Their high-frequency-trading platform was designed, in typical Goldman style, as a centralized hub-and-spoke system. Every signal sent was required to pass through the mother ship in Manhattan before it went back out into the marketplace. &amp;#x201C;But the latency [the five milliseconds] wasn&amp;#x2019;t mainly due to the physical distance,&amp;#x201D; says Serge. &amp;#x201C;It was because the traffic was going through layers and layers of corporate switching equipment.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After a few months working on the 42nd floor of One New York Plaza (at the time the site of Goldman&amp;#x2019;s main equity trading floor and once the site of the old Salomon Brothers trading floor) Serge came to the conclusion that the best thing they could do with Goldman&amp;#x2019;s high-frequency-trading platform was to scrap it altogether and build a new one from scratch. His bosses weren&amp;#x2019;t interested. &amp;#x201C;The business model of Goldman Sachs was if there is an opportunity to make money right away, let&amp;#x2019;s do that,&amp;#x201D; he says. &amp;#x201C;But if there was something long-term, they weren&amp;#x2019;t that interested.&amp;#x201D; Something would change in the stock market (an exchange would introduce a new, complicated rule, for instance), and that change would create an immediate opportunity to make money. &amp;#x201C;They&amp;#x2019;d want to do it immediately,&amp;#x201D; says Serge. &amp;#x201C;But if you think about it, it&amp;#x2019;s just patching the existing system, constantly. The existing code base becomes an elephant that&amp;#x2019;s difficult to maintain.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dc&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;hat is how he spent the vast majority of his two years at Goldman, maintaining the elephant. Oddly, he found his job more interesting than the stock-market trading he was enabling. &amp;#x201C;I think the engineering problems are much more interesting than the business problems,&amp;#x201D; he says. &amp;#x201C;Finance is just who gets money. Does it wind up in the right pocket or the left pocket? It just so happens that the companies that make money are the companies like Goldman Sachs. You can&amp;#x2019;t really win in that game unless you are one of these people who is receiving the hints.&amp;#x201D; He understood that Goldman&amp;#x2019;s quants were forever dreaming up new trading strategies, in the form of algorithms, for the robots to execute, and that these traders were meant to be extremely shrewd. He grasped further that &amp;#x201C;all their algorithms are premised on some sort of prediction&amp;#x2014;predicting something one second into the future.&amp;#x201D; But you needed only to have observed the 2008 stock-market crash from inside Goldman Sachs, as Serge had, to see that what seemed predictable often was not. Day after volatile day in September 2008, Goldman&amp;#x2019;s supposedly brilliant traders were losing tens of millions of dollars. &amp;#x201C;All of the expectations didn&amp;#x2019;t work,&amp;#x201D; recalls Serge. &amp;#x201C;They thought they controlled the market, but it was an illusion. Everyone would come into work and were blown away by the fact that they couldn&amp;#x2019;t control anything at all. . . . Finance is a gambling game for people who enjoy gambling.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Serge wasn&amp;#x2019;t a gambler, by nature. He preferred the deterministic world of programming to the pseudo-deterministic world of speculation, and he never fully grasped the connection between his work and the Goldman traders&amp;#x2019;. He knew they were obsessed with the speed he created for them, but he was never convinced the work he was doing to speed up their robots led to greater profits. &amp;#x201C;It wasn&amp;#x2019;t ever clear if we shaved off half a millisecond what the advantage would be,&amp;#x201D; he says. &amp;#x201C;We did studies, but they were imperfect and not conclusive.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The obvious thing he did to make Goldman&amp;#x2019;s robots faster was exactly what he had done at IDT to enable millions of phone calls to find their cheapest route: he decentralized Goldman&amp;#x2019;s system. Rather than have signals travel from the various exchanges back to the Goldman hub, he set up separate mini Goldman hubs inside each of the exchanges. But most of his time was spent simply patching the old code. To do this he and the other Goldman programmers resorted, every day, to open-source software, available free to anyone for any purpose. The tools and components they used were not specifically designed for financial markets, but they could be adapted to repair Goldman&amp;#x2019;s plumbing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Serge quickly discovered, to his surprise, that Goldman had a one-way relationship with open source. They took huge amounts of free software off the Web, but they did not return it after he had modified it, even when his modifications were very slight and of general rather than financial use. &amp;#x201C;Once I took some open-source components, repackaged them to come up with a component that was not even used at Goldman Sachs,&amp;#x201D; he says. &amp;#x201C;It was basically a way to make two computers look like one, so if one went down the other could jump in and perform the task.&amp;#x201D; He described the pleasure of his innovation this way: &amp;#x201C;It created something out of chaos. When you create something out of chaos, essentially, you reduce the entropy in the world.&amp;#x201D; He went to his boss, a fellow named Adam Schlesinger, and asked if he could release it back into open source, as was his inclination. &amp;#x201C;He said it was now Goldman&amp;#x2019;s property,&amp;#x201D; recalls Serge. &amp;#x201C;He was quite tense. When I mentioned it, it was very close to bonus time. And he didn&amp;#x2019;t want any disturbances.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Open source was an idea that depended on collaboration and sharing, and Serge had a long history of contributing to it. He didn&amp;#x2019;t fully understand how Goldman could think it was O.K. to benefit so greatly from the work of others and then behave so selfishly toward them. &amp;#x201C;You don&amp;#x2019;t create intellectual property,&amp;#x201D; he said. &amp;#x201C;You create a program that does something.&amp;#x201D; But from then on, on instructions from Schlesinger, he treated everything on Goldman Sachs&amp;#x2019;s servers, even if it had just been transferred there from open source, as Goldman Sachs&amp;#x2019;s property. (At Serge&amp;#x2019;s trial Kevin Marino, his lawyer, flashed two pages of computer code: the original, with its open-source license on top, and a replica, with the open-source license stripped off and replaced by the Goldman Sachs license.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The funny thing was Serge actually liked Adam Schlesinger and most of the other people he worked with at Goldman. He liked less the environment the firm created for them to work in. &amp;#x201C;Everyone lived for the year-end number,&amp;#x201D; he believes. &amp;#x201C;You get satisfied when the bonus is sizable and you get not satisfied when the number is not. Everything there is very possessive.&amp;#x201D; It made no sense to him the way people were paid individually for achievements that were essentially collective. &amp;#x201C;It was quite competitive. Everyone&amp;#x2019;s trying to show how good their individual contribution to the team is. Because the team doesn&amp;#x2019;t get the bonus, the individual does.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More to the point, the environment Goldman created for its employees, he felt, did not encourage good programming because good programming is by nature collaborative. &amp;#x201C;Essentially there was very minimal connections between people,&amp;#x201D; he says. &amp;#x201C;In telecom you usually have some synergies between people. Meetings when people exchange ideas. They aren&amp;#x2019;t under stress in the same way. At Goldman it was always &amp;#x2018;Some component is broken and we&amp;#x2019;re losing money because of it. Fix it now.&amp;#x2019; &amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The programmers assigned to fix the code sat in cubicles and hardly spoke to one another. &amp;#x201C;When two people wanted to talk they wouldn&amp;#x2019;t just do it out on the floor,&amp;#x201D; says Serge. &amp;#x201C;They would go to one of the offices around the floor and close the door. I never had that experience in telecom or academia.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dc&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;y the time the financial crisis hit, Serge had a reputation of which he himself was unaware: he was known to corporate recruiters outside Goldman as the best programmer in the firm. &amp;#x201C;There were 20 guys on Wall Street who could do what Serge could do,&amp;#x201D; says a headhunter who works often for high-frequency-trading firms. &amp;#x201C;And he was one of the best, if not the best.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At Goldman the programmer types tended not to know their true worth. They were in a different room from the traders, who were far more alive to the bigger picture, to their context. They knew their worth in the marketplace, down to the last penny. They understood the connection between what they did and how much money was made, and were good at exaggerating the importance of the link. Serge wasn&amp;#x2019;t like that. He was a little-picture person, a narrow problem solver. &amp;#x201C;I think he didn&amp;#x2019;t know his own value,&amp;#x201D; says the recruiter. &amp;#x201C;He compensated for being narrow by being good. He was that good.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given his character, and his situation, it&amp;#x2019;s hardly surprising that the market kept finding Serge Aleynikov and telling him what he was worth, rather than the other way around. A few months into his new job, headhunters were calling him every other week. A year into his new job he had a job offer from UBS, the Swiss bank, and a promise to bump up his salary to $400,000 a year. Serge didn&amp;#x2019;t particularly want to leave Goldman Sachs just to go and work at another big Wall Street firm, and so when Goldman offered to match the offer, he stayed. But in early 2009 he had another call, with a very different kind of offer: to create a trading platform from scratch for a new hedge fund run by a 39-year-old Russian fellow named Misha Malyshev.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The prospect of creating a new platform, rather than constantly patching an old one, excited him. Plus they were willing to pay him more than a million dollars a year to do it, and suggested they might even open an office for him near his home in New Jersey. He agreed and then told Goldman he was leaving. His bosses asked him what they could do to persuade him to stay. &amp;#x201C;They were trying to pursue me into this monetary discussion,&amp;#x201D; says Serge. &amp;#x201C;I told them it wasn&amp;#x2019;t the money. It was the chance to build a new system from the ground up.&amp;#x201D; He missed his telecom work environment. &amp;#x201C;Whereas at IDT I was really seeing the results of my work, here you had this monstrous system and you are patching it right and left. No one is giving you the whole picture. I had a feeling no one at Goldman really knows how it works as a whole, and they are just uncomfortable admitting that.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He agreed to hang around for six weeks and teach other Goldman people everything he knew, so they could continue to find and fix the broken bands in their gigantic rubber ball. Four times in the course of those last weeks he mailed himself source code he was working on. (He&amp;#x2019;d later be accused of sending himself 32 megabytes of code, but what he sent was essentially the same 8 megabytes of code four times over.) The files contained a lot of open-source code he had worked with, and modified, over the past two years, mingled together with code that wasn&amp;#x2019;t open source but proprietary to Goldman Sachs. As he would later try and fail to explain to an F.B.I. agent, he hoped to disentangle the one from the other, in case he needed to remind himself how he had done what he had done with the open-source code, in the event he might need to do it again. He sent these files the same way he had sent himself files nearly every week, since his first month on the job at Goldman. &amp;#x201C;No one had ever said a word to me about it,&amp;#x201D; he says. He pulled up his browser and typed into it the words: Free Subversion Repository. Up popped a list of places that stored code, for free, and in a convenient fashion. He clicked the first link on the list. The entire process took about eight seconds. And then he did what he had always done since he first started programming computers: he deleted his bash history. To access the computer he was required to type his password. If he didn&amp;#x2019;t delete his bash history, his password would be there to see, for anyone who had access to the system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#x2019;t an entirely innocent act. &amp;#x201C;I knew that they wouldn&amp;#x2019;t be happy about it,&amp;#x201D; he says, because he knew their attitude was that anything that happened to be on Goldman&amp;#x2019;s servers was the wholly owned property of Goldman Sachs&amp;#x2014;even when Serge himself had taken that code from open source. When asked how he felt when he did it, he says, &amp;#x201C;It felt like speeding. Speeding in the car.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dc&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he trial of Serge Aleynikov lasted 10 days and was notable for its paucity of informed outsiders. High-frequency trading is a small world, and the people who do it, or know anything at all about it, apparently have far less interest in testifying at trials than in making their personal fortunes. The one outside expert witness on the subject called by the government, a professor at Illinois Institute of Technology named Benjamin Van Vliet, had never actually done any high-frequency trading himself and had little to add on the value or the gist of what Serge had taken. About the market itself he was badly misinformed. (He described Goldman Sachs as &amp;#x201C;the New York Yankees&amp;#x201D; of high-frequency trading.) He turned out to have testified as an expert witness in an earlier trial involving the theft of high-frequency-trading code, after which the judge had described what he&amp;#x2019;d said as &amp;#x201C;utter baloney.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The jury consisted mainly of high-school graduates and lacked anyone with experience programming computers. &amp;#x201C;They would bring my computer into the courtroom,&amp;#x201D; recalls Serge incredulously. &amp;#x201C;They would pull out the hard drive and show it to the jury. As evidence!&amp;#x201D; Save for Misha Malyshev, Serge&amp;#x2019;s brief employer, the people who took the stand had no credible knowledge of high-frequency trading: how the money is made, what sort of computer code is valuable, etc. Malyshev, who&amp;#x2019;d been subpoenaed as a witness for the prosecution, testified that Goldman&amp;#x2019;s code was of no use whatsoever in the system he&amp;#x2019;d hired Serge to build&amp;#x2014;he insisted that it had never been his plan to import code from anywhere because he wanted to build Teza&amp;#x2019;s system from scratch. He wanted something flexible and fast, that he could continuously upgrade. Even if offered Goldman&amp;#x2019;s entire high-frequency-trading platform he would not have been interested&amp;#x2014;but when he looked over he saw that half the jury appeared to be sleeping. &amp;#x201C;If I were a juror, and I wasn&amp;#x2019;t a programmer,&amp;#x201D; says Serge, &amp;#x201C;it would be very difficult for me to understand why I did what I did.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&amp;#x2019;s role in the trial was to make genuine understanding even more difficult. Its lawyers coached witnesses; its employees, on the witness stand, behaved more like salesmen for the prosecution than citizens of the state. &amp;#x201C;It&amp;#x2019;s not that they lied,&amp;#x201D; says Serge. &amp;#x201C;But they told things that were not in their expertise. When [his former boss Adam] Schlesinger was asked about the code, he just said everything at Goldman is proprietary. I wouldn&amp;#x2019;t say he lied, but he was misunderstood.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gorging on the Truth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dc&quot;&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;ur system of justice was a poor tool for digging out a rich truth. What was really needed, it seemed to me, was for Serge Aleynikov to be forced to explain what he had done, and why, to people able to understand the explanation and judge it. Goldman Sachs had never asked him to explain himself, and the F.B.I. had not sought help from someone who actually knew anything at all about computers or the high-frequency-trading business. And so over two nights, in a private room of a Wall Street restaurant, I convened a kind of second trial. To serve as both jury and prosecution, I invited half a dozen people intimately familiar with Goldman Sachs, high-frequency trading, and computer programming.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of these people were authorities on our abstruse new stock market; several had written high-frequency code; one had actually developed software for Goldman&amp;#x2019;s high-frequency traders. All were men. Among them, they&amp;#x2019;d grown up in four different countries, but all now lived in the United States and worked on Wall Street. Like most Wall Street people, they were naturally cynical, of both Goldman Sachs and Serge Aleynikov. They&amp;#x2019;d followed his case in the newspapers and noted the shiver it had sent down the spines of Wall Street&amp;#x2019;s software developers. Until Serge was sent to jail for doing it, Wall Street programmers routinely took code they had worked on when they left for new jobs. &amp;#x201C;A guy got put in jail for taking something no one understood,&amp;#x201D; as one of them put it. &amp;#x201C;Every tech programmer out there got the message: Take code and you could go to jail. It was huge.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, they assumed that if Serge had been sentenced to eight years in jail he must have done &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; wrong. They just hadn&amp;#x2019;t bothered to figure out what that was. Now they would.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The restaurant was one of those old-school Wall Street places that charges you a thousand bucks for a private room and then more or less challenges you to eat your way back to even. Food and drink arrived in massive quantities: vast platters of lobster and crab, steaks the size of desktop computer screens, steaming mountains of potatoes and spinach. It was the sort of meal cooked decades ago, for traders who spent their days trusting their gut and their nights rewarding it, but this monstrous feast was now being served to a collection of weedy technologists, the people who controlled the machines that now controlled the markets, and who had, in the bargain, put the old school out of business. They sat around the table staring at the piles of food, like a conquering army of eunuchs who had stumbled into their enemy&amp;#x2019;s harem. At any rate, they made hardly a dent. Serge, for his part, ate so little, and with so little interest, that I half expected him to lift off his chair and float up to the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His new jurors began, interestingly, by asking him lots of personal questions. They wanted to figure out what kind of guy he was. They took an interest, for example, in his job-market history and noted that his behavior was pretty consistently that of a geek who had more interest in his work than how much money he made from it. They established fairly quickly&amp;#x2014;how, I do not know&amp;#x2014;that he was not just smart but seriously gifted. &amp;#x201C;These guys are usually smart in one small area,&amp;#x201D; one of them later explained to me. &amp;#x201C;For a technologist to be so totally dominant in so many areas is just really, really unusual.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They then began to probe his career at Goldman Sachs. They were surprised to learn that he had &amp;#x201C;super-user status&amp;#x201D; inside Goldman, which is to say he was one of a handful of people (roughly 45, in a firm with more than 32,000 employees) who could log in as an administrator to the system. Such privileged access would have enabled him, at any time, to buy a cheap USB flash drive, plug it into his terminal, and take all of Goldman&amp;#x2019;s computer code, without anyone having any idea that he had done so. That fact alone didn&amp;#x2019;t prove anything to them. As one pointed out to Serge directly, lots of thieves are sloppy and careless; just because he was sloppy and careless didn&amp;#x2019;t mean he was not a thief. On the other hand, they all agreed, there wasn&amp;#x2019;t anything the least bit suspicious, much less nefarious, about the manner in which he had taken what he had taken. Using a subversion repository to store code and deleting your bash history were common practices, especially if you typed your password into command lines. In short, Serge had not behaved like a man trying to cover his tracks. One of those assembled stated the obvious: &amp;#x201C;If deleting the bash history was so clever and devious, why had Goldman ever found out he&amp;#x2019;d taken anything?&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dc&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he story the F.B.I. found so unconvincing&amp;#x2014;that Serge had taken the files because he thought he might later like to parse the open-source code contained within&amp;#x2014;made complete sense to the new jurors. As Goldman hadn&amp;#x2019;t permitted him to release his debugged or improved code back to the public&amp;#x2014;possibly in violation of the original free licenses, which often stated that improvements must be publicly shared&amp;#x2014;the only way to get his hands on these was to take the Goldman code. That he had taken, in the bargain, some code that wasn&amp;#x2019;t open source, which happened to be contained in the same files as the open-source code, surprised no one. Grabbing a bunch of files that contained both open-source and non-open-source code was an efficient, quick, and dirty way to collect the open-source code, even if the open-source code was the only part that interested him. It would have made far less sense for him to hunt around the Internet for the open-source code he wanted, as it was scattered all over cyberspace. It was entirely plausible to them that Serge&amp;#x2019;s interest was confined to the open-source code because that was the general-purpose code that might be re-purposed later. The Goldman proprietary code was written specifically for Goldman&amp;#x2019;s platform; it would have been of little use in any new system he wished to build. (Two small pieces of code Serge had sent into Teza&amp;#x2019;s computers before his arrest both came with open-source licenses.) &amp;#x201C;Even if he had taken Goldman&amp;#x2019;s whole platform, it would have been faster and better for him to write the new platform himself,&amp;#x201D; said one juror.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several times he surprised them with his answers. They were all shocked, for instance, that from the day he arrived at Goldman he had been able to send Goldman&amp;#x2019;s source code to himself weekly without anyone at Goldman saying a word to him about it. &amp;#x201C;At Citadel if you install a USB drive into your workstation, someone is standing next to you within five minutes, asking you what the hell you are doing,&amp;#x201D; said one. Most were surprised by how little he had taken in relation to the whole: eight megabytes in a platform that consisted of an estimated one gigabyte of code. The most cynical among them were surprised mostly by what he had &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; taken.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;Did you take the strats?&amp;#x201D; asked one (meaning Goldman&amp;#x2019;s trading strategies).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;No,&amp;#x201D; said Serge. That was one thing the prosecutors hadn&amp;#x2019;t accused him of.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;But that&amp;#x2019;s the secret sauce, if there is one,&amp;#x201D; said the juror. &amp;#x201C;If you&amp;#x2019;re going to take something, take the strats.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;I wasn&amp;#x2019;t interested in the strats,&amp;#x201D; said Serge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;But that&amp;#x2019;s like stealing the jewelry box without the jewels,&amp;#x201D; said another juror.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;You had super-user status!&amp;#x201D; said the first. &amp;#x201C;You could easily have taken the strats. Why didn&amp;#x2019;t you?&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;To me, the technology really is not interesting,&amp;#x201D; said Serge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;You weren&amp;#x2019;t interested in how they made hundreds of millions of dollars?&amp;#x201D; asked someone else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;Not really,&amp;#x201D; said Serge. &amp;#x201C;It&amp;#x2019;s all one big gamble, one way or another.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dc&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;ecause they had seen it before, in other programmer types, they were not totally shocked by his indifference to Goldman&amp;#x2019;s trading, or by how far Goldman had kept him from the action. Talking to a programmer type about the trading business was a bit like talking to the house plumber at work in the basement about the card game the Mafia don was running upstairs. &amp;#x201C;He knew &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; little about the business context,&amp;#x201D; one of the jurors said upon leaving the informal trial. &amp;#x201C;You&amp;#x2019;d have to try to know as little as he did.&amp;#x201D; Another added, &amp;#x201C;He knew as much as they wanted him to know about how they made money, which was virtually nothing. He wasn&amp;#x2019;t there for very long. He came in with no context. And he spent all of his time troubleshooting.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At least some part of the reason he remained oblivious to the nature of the trading business, they all noticed, was that his heart was elsewhere. &amp;#x201C;I think passion plays a big role,&amp;#x201D; said a juror who himself had spent his entire career writing code. &amp;#x201C;The moment he started talking about coding his eyes lit up.&amp;#x201D; Another added, &amp;#x201C;The fact that he kept trying to work on open-source shit even while he was at Goldman says something about the guy.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They didn&amp;#x2019;t all agree that what Serge had taken had no value, either to him or to Goldman. But what value it might have had in creating a new system would have been trivial and indirect. &amp;#x201C;I can guarantee you this: he did not steal code to use it on some other system,&amp;#x201D; one said, and none of the others disagreed. For my part I didn&amp;#x2019;t fully understand why some parts of Goldman&amp;#x2019;s system might not be useful in some other system. &amp;#x201C;Goldman&amp;#x2019;s code base is like buying a really old house,&amp;#x201D; one of the jurors explained. &amp;#x201C;And you take the trouble to soup it up. But it still has the problems of a really old house. Teza [the new high-frequency-trading firm for which Serge left Goldman] was going to build a new house, on new land. Why would you take 100-year-old copper pipes and put them in my new house? It isn&amp;#x2019;t that they couldn&amp;#x2019;t be used; it&amp;#x2019;s that the amount of trouble involved in making it useful is ridiculous.&amp;#x201D; A third added, &amp;#x201C;It&amp;#x2019;s &lt;i&gt;way&lt;/i&gt; easier to start from scratch.&amp;#x201D; (Their conviction grew even stronger when they learned&amp;#x2014;later, as Serge failed to mention it at the dinners&amp;#x2014;that the new system Serge planned to create was likely to be written in a different computer language than the Goldman code.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dc&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he perplexing question, at least to me, was why Serge had taken anything at all. A full month after he&amp;#x2019;d left Goldman he still had barely touched the code he had taken. If the code was so unimportant to him that he didn&amp;#x2019;t bother to open it up and study it, if most of it was either so clunky or so particular to Goldman&amp;#x2019;s system that it was next to useless outside Goldman, why take it at all? Oddly, the market insiders didn&amp;#x2019;t find this hard to understand. One of them later put it this way:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;If Person A steals a bike from Person B, then Person A is riding a bike to school, and Person B is walking. A is better off at the expense of B. That is clear-cut and most people&amp;#x2019;s view of theft. In Serge&amp;#x2019;s case, think of being at a company for three years and you carry a spiral notebook and write everything down. Everything about your meetings, your ideas, products, sales, client meetings&amp;#x2014;it&amp;#x2019;s all written down in that notebook. You leave for your new job and take the notebook with you (as most people do). The contents of your notebook relate to your history at the prior company, but have very little relevance to your new job. You may never look at it again. Maybe there are some ideas or templates or thoughts you can draw on. But that notebook is related to your prior job, and you will start a new notebook at your new job which will make the old one irrelevant. . . . For programmers their code is their spiral notebook. [It enables them] to remember what they worked on&amp;#x2014;but it has very little relevance to what they will build next. . . . He took a spiral notebook that had very little relevance outside of Goldman Sachs.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The real mystery, to the insiders, wasn&amp;#x2019;t why Serge had done what he had done. It was why Goldman Sachs had done what it had done. Why on earth call the F.B.I.? Why coach your employees to say what they need to say on a witness stand to maximize the possibility of sending him to prison? Why exploit the ignorance of both the general public and the legal system about complex financial matters to punish this one little guy? Why must the spider always eat the fly?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They had no end of theories about this, but one was more intriguing than the others. It had to do with the nature of Goldman Sachs these days, and the way people who work for the firm get ahead. As one put it, &amp;#x201C;Every manager of a Wall Street tech group likes to have people believe that his guys are geniuses. Their whole persona among their peers is that what they and their team do can&amp;#x2019;t be replicated. When people find out that 95 percent of their code is open-source, it kills that perception. . . . So when the security people come to them and tell them about the downloads, they can&amp;#x2019;t say, &amp;#x2018;No big deal.&amp;#x2019; And they can&amp;#x2019;t say, &amp;#x2018;I don&amp;#x2019;t know what he took.&amp;#x2019; &amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To put it another way: the process that ended with Serge Aleynikov sitting inside a federal prison may have started with some Goldman Sachs employees concerned about their bonuses. As they walked down Wall Street and into the night, one of the jurors said, &amp;#x201C;I&amp;#x2019;m actually nauseous. It makes me sick.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cyrus Vance&amp;#x2019;s Secret Sauce&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dc&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he mystery the jury of his peers had more trouble solving was Serge himself. He seems, and perhaps even is, completely at peace with the world. Had you lined up the people at those two Wall Street dinners and asked the American public to vote for the man who had just lost his marriage, his home, his job, his life&amp;#x2019;s savings, and his reputation, Serge would have come in dead last. At one point one of the people at the table stopped the conversation about computer code and asked, &amp;#x201C;Why aren&amp;#x2019;t you angry?&amp;#x201D; Serge just smiled back at him. &amp;#x201C;No, really,&amp;#x201D; said the other. &amp;#x201C;How do you stay so calm? I&amp;#x2019;d be fucking going crazy.&amp;#x201D; Serge smiled again. &amp;#x201C;But what does craziness give you?&amp;#x201D; he said. &amp;#x201C;What does negative demeanor give you as a person? It doesn&amp;#x2019;t give you anything. You know that something happened. Your life happened to go in that particular route. If you know that you&amp;#x2019;re innocent, know it. But at the same time, you know you are in trouble and this is how it&amp;#x2019;s going to be.&amp;#x201D; To which he added, &amp;#x201C;To some extent I&amp;#x2019;m glad this happened to me. I think it strengthened my understanding of what living is all about.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the comfort of the Wall Street cornucopia, that notion&amp;#x2014;that the hellish experience he&amp;#x2019;d been through had actually been good for him&amp;#x2014;was too weird to pursue, and they returned to discussing computer code and high-frequency trading. But Serge actually believed all of this. Before his arrest&amp;#x2014;before he lost all he thought important&amp;#x2014;he went through his days and nights in a certain state of mind: a bit self-absorbed, prone to anxiety and worry about his status in the world. &amp;#x201C;When I was arrested I couldn&amp;#x2019;t sleep,&amp;#x201D; he says. &amp;#x201C;When I saw articles in the newspaper I would tremble at the fear of losing my reputation. Now I just smile. I no longer panic. Or panic at the idea that something could go wrong.&amp;#x201D; By the time he was first sent to prison, his wife had left him, and he had no money, and no one to turn to. He needed other people. &amp;#x201C;He didn&amp;#x2019;t have very close friends,&amp;#x201D; says Masha Leder. &amp;#x201C;He never did. He&amp;#x2019;s not a people person. He didn&amp;#x2019;t even have anyone to be power of attorney.&amp;#x201D; Out of a sense of Russian solidarity, and pity, she took the job&amp;#x2014;which meant, among other things, frequent trips to see Serge in prison. &amp;#x201C;Every time I would come to visit him in jail, I would leave energized by him,&amp;#x201D; she says. &amp;#x201C;He radiated so much energy and positive emotions that it was like therapy for me, to visit him. His eyes opened to how the world really is. And he started talking to people. For the first time! He would say: People in jail have the best stories. He could have considered himself a tragedy. And he didn&amp;#x2019;t.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prison in which Serge spent his first four months also housed violent criminals. It was essentially nonverbal, but he didn&amp;#x2019;t find it hard to stay out of trouble, and even found people he could talk to, and enjoy talking to. When they moved him to the low-security prison at Fort Dix he was still in a room crammed with hundreds of other roommates, but now had space to work. He remained in some physical distress, mainly because he refused to eat meat. &amp;#x201C;His body, he had really bad times there,&amp;#x201D; says Leder. &amp;#x201C;He lived on beans and rice. He was always hungry. I&amp;#x2019;d buy him these yogurts and he would gulp them down one after another.&amp;#x201D; His mind still worked fine, though, and a lifetime of programming in cube farms had left him with the ability to focus in prison conditions. A few months into Serge&amp;#x2019;s jail term Masha received a thick envelope from him. It contained roughly a hundred pages covered on both sides in Serge&amp;#x2019;s meticulous eight-point script. It was computer code&amp;#x2014;a solution to some high-frequency-trading problem. Serge was afraid if the guards found it they would deem it suspicious, and confiscate it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A year after he&amp;#x2019;d been sent away the appeal of Serge Aleynikov was finally heard, by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. The judgment was swift, unlike anything his lawyer, Kevin Marino, had seen in his career. The very day Marino&amp;#x2014;who by then was working gratis, for a client who was dead broke&amp;#x2014;made his argument the judges ordered Serge released, on the grounds that the laws he stood accused of breaking did not actually apply to his case. At noon on February 17, 2012, Serge was set free.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dc&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; few months later Marino noticed that the government had failed to return Serge&amp;#x2019;s passport. That&amp;#x2019;s odd, he thought, and called and asked for it. The passport never arrived; instead Serge, now staying with friends in New Jersey, was arrested again and taken to jail. He had no idea what he was being arrested for, and neither did his lawyer. &amp;#x201C;When I got the call,&amp;#x201D; says Marino, &amp;#x201C;I thought it might have something to do with Serge&amp;#x2019;s child support.&amp;#x201D; It didn&amp;#x2019;t. A few days later the Manhattan D.A., Cyrus Vance Jr., sent out a press release to announce that the state of New York was charging Serge Aleynikov with &amp;#x201C;accessing and duplicating a complex proprietary and highly confidential computer source code owned by Goldman Sachs.&amp;#x201D; The press release went on to say that &amp;#x201C;the code is so highly confidential that it is known in the industry as the firm&amp;#x2019;s &amp;#x2018;secret sauce,&amp;#x2019; &amp;#x201D; and thanked Goldman Sachs for its cooperation. The only employee of Goldman Sachs to go to jail in the aftermath of the financial crisis was the employee Goldman Sachs wanted sent to jail, for taking something from Goldman Sachs. Apparently now they wanted him back in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Marino recognized the phrase &amp;#x201C;secret sauce.&amp;#x201D; It hadn&amp;#x2019;t come from &amp;#x201C;the industry&amp;#x201D; but from his opening statement in Serge&amp;#x2019;s first trial, when he mocked the prosecutors for treating Goldman&amp;#x2019;s code as if it were some &amp;#x201C;secret sauce.&amp;#x201D; Otherwise Serge&amp;#x2019;s re-arrest made no sense to him. To avoid double jeopardy, the Manhattan D.A.&amp;#x2019;s office had found new crimes with which to charge Serge for the same actions. But the sentencing guidelines for the new crimes meant that, even if convicted, it was possible he wouldn&amp;#x2019;t have to return to jail. He&amp;#x2019;d already served time, for crimes the court ultimately determined he had not committed. Marino called the D.A.&amp;#x2019;s office. &amp;#x201C;They told me that they didn&amp;#x2019;t need him to be punished anymore, but they did need him to be held accountable,&amp;#x201D; says Marino. &amp;#x201C;They want him to plead guilty and let him go on time served. I told them in the politest terms possible that they can go fuck themselves. They ruined his life.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, they didn&amp;#x2019;t. &amp;#x201C;Inside of me I was completely witnessing,&amp;#x201D; said Serge, about the night of his re-arrest. &amp;#x201C;There was no fear, no panic, no negativity.&amp;#x201D; His children had re-attached themselves to him, and he had a new world of people to whom he felt close. He thought he was living his life as well as it had ever been lived. He&amp;#x2019;d even started a memoir, to explain what had happened to anyone who might be interested. As he wrote:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;If the incarceration experience doesn&amp;#x2019;t break your spirit, it changes you in a way that you lose many fears. You begin to realize that your life is not ruled by your ego and ambition and that it can end any day at any time. So why worry? You learn that, just like on the street, there is life in prison, and random people get there based on the jeopardy of the system. The prisons are filled with people who crossed the law, as well as by those who were incidentally and circumstantially picked and crushed by somebody else&amp;#x2019;s agenda. On the other hand, as a vivid benefit, you become very much independent of material property and learn to appreciate very simple pleasures in life such as the sunlight and morning breeze.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;GOLDMAN SACHS RESPONDS: Goldman Sachs has spent millions of dollars and tens of thousands of hours developing the proprietary source code and technology used in our market-making business. The firm has put in place extensive safeguards to protect this valuable technology. In addition to contractual limits on disseminating confidential information, the firm restricts access to proprietary technology to those employees whose duties designing and maintaining the technology require such access. . . . In this case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit determined that Sergey Aleynikov, minutes before his going-away party, &amp;#x201C;encrypted and uploaded to a server in Germany more than 500,000 lines of source code for Goldman&amp;#x2019;s HFT [high-frequency-trading] system.&amp;#x201D; While some of those files included open source software, the Court determined that &amp;#x201C;a substantially greater number of the uploaded files contained proprietary code.&amp;#x201D; The Court went on to note that the code &amp;#x201C;could be integrated into a competitor&amp;#x2019;s system&amp;#x201D; and that Mr. Aleynikov then &amp;#x201C;deleted the encryption program as well as the history of his computer commands.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<description>
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;entry&quot;&gt;
                &lt;p class=&quot;postdate&quot;&gt;July 29, 2013&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;During the past several months Bitcoin Co. Ltd., in Thailand, has been in the process of registering with the various Thai government agencies in order to operate in a lawful manner.&amp;#xA0; Included in this due diligence was to reach out to the Bank of Thailand, the governing body that regulates financial transactions in Thailand, and ask for guidance as to any applicable licenses in buying and selling bitcoins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially the Bank of Thailand had bypassed the company&amp;#x2019;s money exchange license on the basis that Bitcoin was not a currency, however the company was invited back, on July 29th, 2013, to participant in a conference about how Bitcoin works in general, and business operations of Bitcoin Co. Ltd.&amp;#xA0;&amp;#xA0; The conference was held with about 15 members of the Bank of Thailand in attendance.&amp;#xA0; During this conference directors of Bitcoin Co. Ltd. gave a presentation about the workings of Bitcoin, the benefits of Bitcoin, incite into the company&amp;#x2019;s operations and future implications of Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the conclusion of the meeting senior members of the &lt;em&gt;Foreign Exchange Administration and Policy Department&lt;/em&gt; advised that due to lack of existing applicable laws, capital controls and the fact that Bitcoin straddles multiple financial facets the &lt;strong&gt;following Bitcoin activities are illegal in Thailand&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Buying Bitcoins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selling Bitcoins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buying any goods or services in exchange for Bitcoins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selling any goods or services for Bitcoins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sending Bitcoins to anyone located outside of Thailand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Receiving Bitcoins from anyone located outside of Thailand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on such a broad and encompassing advisement, Bitcoin Co. Ltd. therefore has no choice but to suspend operations until such as time that the laws in Thailand are updated to account for the existance of Bitcoin.&amp;#xA0; The Bank of Thailand has said they will further consider the issue, but did not give any specific timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

Observations from a Tipless Restaurant
</title>

<description>
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;post-343&quot; class=&quot;post-343 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-posts&quot;&gt;
		

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is part 2 of a series detailing what I learned from operating our farm-to-table flagship restaurant, the Linkery, as a &amp;#x201C;no-tipping&amp;#x201D; restaurant that instead charged a fixed percentage for service, from 2006 to 2013. We also operated a sister restaurant, El Take It Easy, that followed the traditional tipping model, allowing for a fairly direct comparison.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to understand how we ended up switching to a fixed service charge and declining tips, it&amp;#x2019;s helpful to understand some financial and legal facts about the restaurant industry that are not widely communicated to the public at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is that, for the most part, the restaurant industry operates on very slim margins. There are some restaurants that are very profitable, but the vast majority are not. I&amp;#x2019;ve read that the average profit for a restaurant is 4% of its revenue, and in my experience most independent restaurants do not have any real profit at all. More typically the owner is able to pay herself for her work, and that&amp;#x2019;s about it. This fact is important because it means that, for most jobs in the restaurant industry, the wage paid by the restaurant comes from a limited pool, and there is not a lot of flexibility in the size of the pool &amp;#x2014; if one job gets a $2/hour raise, that most likely means that another job will have its wage reduced by $2/hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, it seems like there would be ways to free up more money for labor, and there are some methods that help.  In the end, though, restaurant-going is so prevelant that the expectations of the market &amp;#x2014; for price, quality, ambience, and so forth &amp;#x2014; are pretty well set in every dimension. And the cost of meeting those expectations is pretty well set, too. So the business model for most restaurants, and what they pay for each job, is tightly constrained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;#x2019;s say that on a typical shift, a restaurant sells $1000 in food and drink. It would be reasonable that, to make that revenue, a restaurant has 2 cooks who work 8 hours each, a dishwasher who works 8 hours, and two servers who work 6 hours each. We can extrapolate from standard industry models that, of the $1000 in sales, there will be $300 available to cover the 36 hours of labor. It just so happens that this math means that everyone in the house will make $8/hour, which is of course both minimum wage and a poverty wage.  But that&amp;#x2019;s just how the pie divides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, wait! We&amp;#x2019;ve forgotten something. There are also 220 extra dollars paid by the guests as tips. (This 22% is typical for restaurants like ours in San Diego &amp;#x2014; the exact amount will change with restaurant style and location.) This tip money could add another $6/hour to everyone&amp;#x2019;s wage, getting everyone up to $14/hr. &amp;#xA0;While $14/hr isn&amp;#x2019;t enough to live well in San Diego, it starts approaching realistic money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, to give the tip money to every worker would be illegal. &amp;#xA0;The law is historically very clear &amp;#x2014; the $220 in tips belongs to the two servers only, and cannot be distributed to any other employees. So, the two servers make a total of about $26/hour each, while everyone else in the restaurant is stuck at $8/hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if you&amp;#x2019;re a server, you&amp;#x2019;re probably nodding your head that this seems fine! However, if you&amp;#x2019;re an owner or manager trying to operate an excellent restaurant, you&amp;#x2019;ve got some problems. From the perspective of the business, the cook and dishwasher are just as important to the guests&amp;#x2019; experience as the server is. In fact, they may be even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; important, particularly if your restaurant&amp;#x2019;s reputation is based on its food. But, now your cooks are making less than 1/3 of what the servers are making. The cooks&amp;#x2019; wage is so low that talented cooks won&amp;#x2019;t be able to live on it, and they will probably leave the industry. Additionally, no matter what cooks you have, there will be a lot of ill will between the producers of the food, who are well below the poverty line, and the servers, who are making white-collar wages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some states (big East Coast restaurant states come to mind, like New York), the government balances this situation by offering what is called a &amp;#x201C;tip credit&amp;#x201D;. The tip credit allows restaurants to pay their front-of-house employees less than minimum wage (usually about $5/hr less), if tips will make up the difference. In the example above, the servers in a &amp;#x201C;tip credit&amp;#x201D; system would most likely end up making about $21/hour and, cooks about $12/hour, and the dishwasher still about $8/hour. To someone like me who puts a lot of demands on his kitchen, this distribution still feels inequitable &amp;#x2014; but it&amp;#x2019;s a lot closer to fair. While the &amp;#x201C;tip credit&amp;#x201D; is a blunt instrument, it does address the wage inequity problem enough to keep the tipping system at least somewhat viable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in California and several other states, the &amp;#x201C;tip credit&amp;#x201D; is not allowed, and the restauranteur has fewer options. The recourse most commonly used in these states is the &amp;#x201C;tipout&amp;#x201D;. Here the servers just give a portion of their tips to the kitchen, usually as part of a cultural expectation created within the restaurant. The problems with depending on a voluntary tipout to equal out the pay on the team are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some servers may decide to withhold a tipout, in a sense cheating the system, and the employers is precluded from redressing this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Servers may use the option of withholding their tipout, to extract special favors from the kitchen regardless of whether those favors hurt other guests or other servers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, with the business disallowed from enforcing the tipout system, control is left to the culture of the team in the restaurant; and humans being humans, more times than not that situation leads to hurt feelings, anger, or worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a tipout system, what started as one enterprise (a restaurant selling its food &amp;amp; hospitality to its guests), has now spawned two completely new, concurrent businesses: the business of the server selling the perception of extra attention to the guest for tips; and the business of the kitchen workers selling favors to the servers for tipout. &amp;#xA0;These additional, parasitic businesses are not focused on improving the quality of the original enterprise.  Instead, these secondary businesses are focused on maximizing income using short term, and proven effective, means. &amp;#xA0;(I won&amp;#x2019;t go into those means here, but you can find many of them &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hotelschool.cornell.edu/research/chr/pubs/tools/tooldetails-13630.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;detailed here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple years, another alternative has started to emerge &amp;#x2014; the lawful tip pool. &amp;#xA0;In this model, the business is permitted by the law of the land to distribute its tips among every member of its team, including kitchen workers. &amp;#xA0;In the Ninth District (the western US), one court decision (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;ved=0CC0QFjAA&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.ca9.uscourts.gov%2Fdatastore%2Fopinions%2F2010%2F02%2F23%2F08-35718.pdf&amp;amp;ei=KE30UejULaSnigKatIGICA&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNElcLJF21lbtNbSkv1A-AJzY-68Tw&amp;amp;sig2=Mp6Y8HwoQQeff6y-L-soRw&amp;amp;bvm=bv.49784469,d.cGE&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cumbie v. Woody Woo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) has paved the way for this, but the US Department of Labor has attempted to nullify that decision by issuing new regulations. &amp;#xA0;It&amp;#x2019;s not clear that the Labor department is actually allowed to trump the court, and the matter is not yet clearly resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2006, however, it was still definitely illegal for a tip pool to include back-of-house workers. &amp;#xA0;The only legal way that tip revenue could be distributed among the whole team was for it to not be tip revenue.  Instead, it had to be an amount charged by the business for its service. In other words, a service charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we, following the lead of places like Chez Panisse, added a line item service charge on our bills, and that allowed us to distribute the money paid for table service in a way that seemed more equitable. &amp;#xA0;Having more equitable distribution in money, of course, led to us having better quality service and food. In turn, we saw a sharp increase in business over the first two months of the new system. &amp;#xA0;Our servers&amp;#x2019; total pay rose to about $22/hour, most of the cooks started making about $12-14 depending on experience, and the diswashers about $10. &amp;#xA0; (Those numbers declined somewhat over the years, as the recession took its toll on restaurant check averages in San Diego).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was big difference, however, between what we did and what places like Chez Panisse had done &amp;#x2014; unlike those other places, and unlike every other sit-down restaurant in America, we refused to accept money beyond the service charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a couple reasons for not letting our guests give extra money beyond the 18% we allocated for the cost of table service. &amp;#xA0;The first reason was that we wanted to make it clear to our guests that we were not trying to take more money from them &amp;#x2014; in fact, we were taking less, by switching from a tipped system that averaged 21-22% of the check, to a fixed 18%. &amp;#xA0;We were reducing our tip income by 15% as a show of good faith to our community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other reason we didn&amp;#x2019;t accept tips was that removing any option for tipping was the only way to remove those two parasitic businesses &amp;#x2014; the side business between the server and guest, and the side business between the server and cooks &amp;#x2014; from our own company. &amp;#xA0;By not allowing these side businesses to exist, we created an environment where all of us were engaged in only one mission, our stated goal of creating remarkable experiences for our guests, around local food and drink. &amp;#xA0;Being in only one business made us like pretty much every other company in America, except that it also made us unlike any other restaurant in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the tension in that, of course, is where the interesting stuff was.&lt;/p&gt;

MIT releases report on its actions in the Aaron Swartz case
</title>

<description>
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;articlebody &quot;&gt;
A much-anticipated report on MIT&amp;#x2019;s actions in relation to the case of Aaron Swartz, a young computer programmer and Internet activist who committed suicide in January, finds no wrongdoing on MIT&amp;#x2019;s part. But the report raises concerns about certain policies and procedures and whether MIT should have been more actively involved in the matter. The report offers a set of forward-looking questions for the Institute as a whole to address.&lt;p&gt;Compilation of &lt;a href=&quot;http://swartz-report.mit.edu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the report&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;#x201C;MIT and the Prosecution of Aaron Swartz,&amp;#x201D; was led by Hal Abelson, the Class of 1922 Professor of Computer Science and Engineering, at the request of MIT President L. Rafael Reif in January. In conducting his review, Abelson was joined by MIT economist and Institute Professor emeritus Peter Diamond; attorney Andrew Grosso, a former assistant U.S. attorney; and MIT assistant provost for administration Douglas Pfeiffer, who provided staff support for the review panel.                                          
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2013/mit-swartz-report-faq-0730.html&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;Read the News Office FAQ on the report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
In preparing its report, this group talked with about 50 people, including MIT faculty, students, alumni and staff; lawyers, police officers and prosecutors; and friends and family of Swartz. It also reviewed about 10,000 pages &lt;a href=&quot;http://swartz-documents.mit.edu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;of documents&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2013/mit-swartz-report-president-reif-letter-0730.html&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;letter to the MIT community&lt;/a&gt; announcing the release of the report, Reif wrote, &amp;#x201C;The review panel&amp;#x2019;s careful account provides something we have not had until now: an independent description of the actual events at MIT and of MIT&amp;#x2019;s decisions in the context of what MIT knew as the events unfolded. The report also sets the record straight by dispelling widely circulated myths. For example, it makes clear that MIT did not &amp;#x2018;target&amp;#x2019; Aaron Swartz, we did not seek federal prosecution, punishment or jail time, and we did not oppose a plea bargain. The report&amp;#x2019;s introduction summarizes some of its most significant findings, but I urge everyone in the MIT community to read the report in its entirety.&amp;#x201D; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of his death, Swartz, who had informal connections to the MIT community, faced 13 federal felony charges relating to his downloading of more than 4 million academic journal papers from the online archive JSTOR, or about 80 percent of the JSTOR library. The downloading was carried out surreptitiously using a laptop computer that was left in a basement wiring closet in an MIT building, physically connected to the MIT computer network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As described in the report, Swartz&amp;#x2019;s death &amp;#x201C;ignited a firestorm on the Internet.&amp;#x201D; Memorial services were held in several locations, including MIT; posthumous awards were given to Swartz; a proposed revision of the law under which he was prosecuted was introduced in Congress; a petition was filed with the White House demanding the firing of the federal prosecutor responsible for the case; and several anonymous cyberattacks were launched, some against MIT, in protest of the handling of the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Position of neutrality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report says that throughout the two years from Swartz&amp;#x2019;s arrest in January 2011 through his suicide in January 2013, MIT maintained a position of neutrality. The Institute made no public statements regarding the merits of the case against Swartz or whether it should proceed, nor did it attempt to influence the prosecutor&amp;#x2019;s decisions on the case, other than to tell the prosecutor that the government should not proceed on the assumption that MIT wanted Aaron Swartz to go to jail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals including Swartz&amp;#x2019;s father, Robert &amp;#x2014; who did undergraduate work at MIT and is a consultant to the MIT Media Lab &amp;#x2014; met with MIT officials during the course of the prosecution and asked MIT to support efforts to have the charges dropped or to secure a plea bargain that would not include jail time. Two MIT faculty members also urged the administration to make such an appeal to the prosecution. MIT considered these views as well as those of faculty who expressed opposing views in deciding neither to press for prosecution nor to advocate on Swartz&amp;#x2019;s behalf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;From studying this review of MIT&amp;#x2019;s role, I am confident that MIT&amp;#x2019;s decisions were reasonable, appropriate and made in good faith,&amp;#x201D; Reif &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2013/mit-swartz-report-president-reif-letter-0730.html&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;wrote in his letter&lt;/a&gt; of this morning. &amp;#x201C;I have heard from many in our community who believe our actions were proper and justified. Others feel differently, and the review panel identifies alternate paths we could have followed, including becoming more actively involved in the case as it evolved. I am sure there will be further discussion and reflection now that we have the report in hand.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key findings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the &lt;a href=&quot;http://swartz-report.mit.edu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report&amp;#x2019;s key findings&lt;/a&gt; are these:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beginning in September 2010, MIT and JSTOR observed massive downloading of JSTOR articles by a laptop connected to MIT&amp;#x2019;s network. The downloading recurred in October and December, and bypassed MIT&amp;#x2019;s attempts to stop it. The scale of the downloading was large enough that it threatened to shut down JSTOR&amp;#x2019;s overall service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MIT did not learn that the person responsible for the downloading was Aaron Swartz until after his arrest, on an initial charge of breaking and entering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MIT called in a Cambridge Police detective to help with its investigation.&amp;#xA0; The detective arrived on campus accompanied by a federal special agent of the Secret Service, but the report found that MIT did not intentionally &amp;#x201C;call in the feds&amp;#x201D; to take over the investigation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MIT did not request that federal charges be brought against Aaron Swartz. It was not consulted about its opinion about appropriate charges or punishment, and it did not offer any.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MIT was not involved in any plea negotiations, and was never asked &amp;#x2014; by either the prosecution or the defense &amp;#x2014; to approve or disapprove of any plea agreement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From early on in the prosecution, MIT adopted a position of neutrality. It did not issue any public statements in support of Aaron Swartz, or against him. MIT privately communicated to the prosecutor&amp;#x2019;s office that it should not think that MIT wanted jail time for Swartz. MIT did not advocate, whether publicly or privately, either for or against jail time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Until Aaron Swartz&amp;#x2019;s suicide, few people urged MIT to take a position on the prosecution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The report notes that faculty were divided on the issue and that there was little student interest. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, the report says that MIT&amp;#x2019;s neutrality stance did not consider factors including &amp;#x201C;that the defendant was an accomplished and well-known contributor to Internet technology&amp;#x201D;; that the law under which he was charged &amp;#x201C;is a poorly drafted and questionable criminal law as applied to modern computing&amp;#x201D;; and that &amp;#x201C;the United States was pursuing an overtly aggressive prosecution.&amp;#x201D; While MIT&amp;#x2019;s position &amp;#x201C;may have been prudent,&amp;#x201D; the report says, &amp;#x201C;it did not duly take into account the wider background&amp;#x201D; of policy issues &amp;#x201C;in which MIT people have traditionally been passionate leaders.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions for the MIT community&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report urges the MIT community to consider and discuss some questions raised by this case, &amp;#x201C;in the hopes that doing so will aid the process of learning from this heartbreaking history.&amp;#x201D; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight questions are included in the report. First of these is whether MIT should develop in-house expertise for dealing with incidents involving possible computer crimes. Other questions concern MIT&amp;#x2019;s policies on data collection, retention and provision to outside bodies; whether MIT should explicitly address the legal and ethical questions associated with Internet activities as part of its curriculum; and whether the Institute should participate more actively in the study of the legal, policy and societal impacts of information technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report also asks whether MIT should become involved, as an institution, in national debates over reform of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, one of the criminal laws under which Swartz was charged. Another question the report asks is whether MIT should strengthen its policies on open access to scholarly publications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No &amp;#x2018;silver bullet&amp;#x2019;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;We recognize the desire for a simple take-away,&amp;#x201D; the report concludes, but adds: &amp;#x201C;We can&amp;#x2019;t offer that. We have not found a silver bullet with which MIT could have simply prevented the tragedy.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the report says, &amp;#x201C;MIT missed an opportunity to demonstrate the leadership that we pride ourselves on.&amp;#x201D; That opportunity existed because &amp;#x201C;MIT is respected for world-class work in information technology, for promoting open access to online information, and for dealing wisely with the risks of computer abuse.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;President Reif responds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2013/mit-swartz-report-president-reif-letter-0730.html&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;his letter&lt;/a&gt; this morning, Reif said that he is &amp;#x201C;grateful to the review panel for framing these important questions &amp;#x2014; some specific to MIT, others focused on topics of national and global significance that mattered very much to Aaron Swartz himself.&amp;#x201D; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;Because these questions bear so directly on the expertise, interests and values of the people of MIT,&amp;#x201D; Reif wrote, &amp;#x201C;I believe we should explore them, respectfully debate our differences and translate our learning into constructive action.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reif also wrote that he has asked Executive Vice President and Treasurer Israel Ruiz &amp;#x201C;to organize a review of MIT policies on the collection, provision and retention of electronic records, so that Academic Council &amp;#x2014; MIT&amp;#x2019;s senior academic and administrative leaders &amp;#x2014; have the background they need to improve them.&amp;#x201D; To address other questions related to MIT policies and resources, Reif will ask Academic Council to propose to him any changes its members deem appropriate by the end of the fall semester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the report&amp;#x2019;s larger questions, Reif announced that he has asked Provost Chris Kaiser to work with Faculty Chair Steven Hall, professor of aeronautics and astronautics, &amp;#x201C;to design a process of community engagement that will allow students, alumni, faculty, staff and MIT Corporation members to explore these subjects together this fall and shape the best course for MIT.&amp;#x201D; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his letter, Reif thanked the members of the MIT community who have been involved in the Swartz case. &amp;#x201C;The report confirms my trust in the members of the MIT community involved in the Swartz events,&amp;#x201D; he wrote. &amp;#x201C;Throughout, they have acted with integrity and heart, and served MIT with outstanding professionalism. I know the last seven months have been hard on them and their families, and they have my deepest respect and gratitude.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reif also reflected on what the loss of Aaron Swartz has meant to Swartz&amp;#x2019;s family and friends, to the many at MIT who passionately support open access, and to the wider world: &amp;#x201C;Knowing the tragedy of Aaron Swartz&amp;#x2019;s death, I read the report with a tremendous sense of sorrow. His family and friends suffered a terrible personal loss, and the Internet community lost an exceptional leader. Even those of us who never knew him mourn the loss of someone so young and so brilliant.&amp;#x201D;

&lt;div class=&quot;article-content clearfix&quot; score=&quot;7.5&quot;&gt;
    
&lt;figure class=&quot;intro-image image center full-width&quot; score=&quot;12.5&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ssll-exploit-demo-640x341.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&quot;caption&quot; score=&quot;17.5&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;A frame from a video demonstration showing BREACH in the process of extracting a 32-character security token in an HTTPS-encrypted Web page.&lt;/div&gt;
	
			
	  &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HTTPS cryptographic scheme, which protects millions of websites, is susceptible to a new attack that allows hackers to pluck e-mail addresses and certain types of security credentials out of encrypted pages, often in as little as 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technique, scheduled to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blackhat.com/us-13/briefings.html#Prado&quot;&gt;demonstrated Thursday&lt;/a&gt; at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas, decodes encrypted data that online banks and e-commerce sites send in responses that are protected by the widely used &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security&quot;&gt;transport layer security&lt;/a&gt; (TLS) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/Secure-Sockets-Layer-SSL&quot;&gt;secure sockets layer&lt;/a&gt; (SSL) protocols. The attack can extract specific pieces of data, such as social security numbers, e-mail addresses, certain types of security tokens, and password-reset links. It works against all versions of TLS and SSL regardless of the encryption algorithm or cipher that's used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It requires that the attacker have the ability to passively monitor the traffic traveling between the end user and website. The attack also requires the attacker to force the victim to visit a malicious link. This can be done by injecting an iframe tag in a website the victim normally visits or, alternatively, by tricking the victim into viewing an e-mail with hidden images that automatically download and generate HTTP requests. The malicious link causes the victim's computer to make multiple requests to the HTTPS server that's being targeted. These requests are used to make &quot;probing guesses&quot; that will be explained shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We're not decrypting the entire channel, but only extracting the secrets we care about,&quot; Yoel Gluck, one of three researchers who developed the attack, told Ars. &quot;It's a very targeted attack. We just need to find one corner [of a website response] that has the token or password change and go after that page to extract the secret. In general, any secret that's relevant [and] located in the body, whether it be on a webpage or an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29&quot;&gt;Ajax&lt;/a&gt; response, we have the ability to extract that secret in under 30 seconds, typically.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the latest attack to chip away at the HTTPS encryption scheme, which forms the cornerstone of virtually all security involving the Web, e-mail, and other Internet services. It joins a pantheon of other hacks introduced over the past few years that bear names such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/09/many-ways-to-break-ssl-with-crime-attacks-experts-warn/&quot;&gt;CRIME&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/09/27/beast_attacks_paypay/&quot;&gt;BEAST&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/03/new-attacks-on-ssl-decrypt-authentication-cookies/&quot;&gt;Lucky 13&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/02/19/ssl_busting_demo/&quot;&gt;SSLStrip&lt;/a&gt;. While none of the attacks have completely undermined the security afforded by HTTPS, they highlight the fragility of the two-decade-old SSL and TLS protocols. The latest attack has been dubbed BREACH, short for Browser Reconnaissance and Exfiltration via Adaptive Compression of Hypertext.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As its name suggests, BREACH works by targeting the data compression that just about every website uses to conserve bandwidth. Based on the standard &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFLATE&quot;&gt;Deflate algorithm&lt;/a&gt;, HTTP compression works by eliminating repetitions in strings of text. Rather than iterating &quot;abcd&quot; four times in a chunk of data, for instance, compression will store the string &quot;abcd&quot; only once and then use space-saving &quot;pointers&quot; that indicate where the remaining three instances of the identical pattern are found. By reducing the number of bytes sent over a connection, compression can significantly speed up the time required for a message to be received. In general, the more repetitions of identical strings found in a data stream, the more potential there will be for compression to reduce the overall size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using what's known as an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drdobbs.com/understanding-oracle-attacks-on-informat/184405917&quot;&gt;oracle technique&lt;/a&gt;, attackers can use compression to gain crucial clues about the contents of an encrypted message. That's because many forms of encryption—including those found in HTTPS—do little or nothing to stop attackers from seeing the size of the encrypted payload. Compression oracle techniques are particularly effective at ferreting out small chunks of text in the encrypted data stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BREACH plucks out targeted text strings from an encrypted response by guessing specific characters and including them in probe requests sent back to the targeted Web service. The attack then compares the byte length of the guess to the original response. When the guess contains the precise combination of characters found in the original response, it will generally result in a payload that's smaller than those produced by incorrect guesses. Because deflate compression stores the repetitive strings without significantly increasing the size of the payload, correct guesses will result in encrypted messages that are smaller than those produced by incorrect guesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On how an Oracle attack works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing an attacker using BREACH might do to retrieve an encrypted e-mail address is guess the @ sign and Internet domain immediately to its right. If guesses such as &quot;@arstechnica.com&quot; and &quot;@dangoodin.com&quot; result in encrypted messages that are larger than the request/response pair without this payload, the attacker knows those addresses aren't included in the targeted response body. Conversely, if compressing &quot;@example.com&quot; against the encrypted address results in no length increase, the attacker will have a high degree of confidence that string is part of the address he's trying to extract. From there, attackers can guess the string to the left of the @ sign character by character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming the encrypted address was johndoe@example.com, guesses of a@example.com, b@example.com, c@example.com, and d@example.com would cause the encrypted message to grow. But when the attacker guesses e@example.com, it would result in no appreciable increase, since that string is included in the targeted message. The attacker would then repeat the same process to recover the remainder of the e-mail address, character by character, moving right to left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technique can be used to extract other types of encrypted text included in Web responses. If the site being targeted sends special tokens designed to prevent so-called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery&quot;&gt;cross-site request forgery attacks&lt;/a&gt;, the credential will almost always contain the same format—such as &quot;request_token=&quot; followed by a long text string such as&quot;bb63e4ba67e24d6b81ed425c5a95b7a2&quot;—each time it's sent. The compression oracle attack can be used to guess this secret string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An attacker would begin by adding the text &quot;request_token=a&quot; to the text of the encrypted page being targeted and send it in a probe request to the Web server. Since the size of the encrypted payload grows, it would be obvious this guess is wrong. By contrast, adding &quot;request_token=b&quot; to the page wouldn't result in any appreciable increase in length, giving the attacker a strong clue that the first character following the equal sign is b. The attacker would use the same technique to guess each remaining character, one at a time, moving left to right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most attacks that use the BREACH technique can be completed by making only a &quot;few thousand&quot; requests to the targeted Web service, in about 30 seconds with optimal network conditions and small secrets, and in minutes to an hour for more advanced secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BREACH, which was devised by Gluck along with researchers Neal Harris and Angelo Prado, builds off the breakthrough &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/09/crime-hijacks-https-sessions/&quot;&gt;CRIME attack&lt;/a&gt; researchers Juliano Rizzo and Thai Duong demonstrated last September. Short for Compression Ratio Info-leak Made Easy, CRIME also exploited the compression in encrypted Web requests to ferret out the plaintext of authentication cookies used to access private user accounts. The research resulted in the suspension of TLS compression and an open networking compression protocol known as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chromium.org/spdy&quot;&gt;SPDY&lt;/a&gt;. BREACH, by contrast, targets the much more widely used HTTP compression that virtually all websites use when sending responses to end users. It works only against data sent in responses by the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you go to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRIME_(security_exploit)&quot;&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; or any of the specialized security pages, they will tell you that CRIME is mitigated as of today and is no longer an interesting attack and nobody cares about it,&quot; Prado said. &quot;So we are bringing it back and making it work better, faster in a different context.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news concerning BREACH is that it works only against certain types of data included in Web responses and then only when an attacker has succeeded in forcing the victim to visit a malicious link. Still, anytime an attacker can extract sensitive data shielded by one of the world's most widely used encryption schemes it's a big deal, particularly as concerns rise about NSA surveillance programs. Making matters more unsettling, there are no easy ways to mitigate the damage BREACH can do. Unlike TLS compression and SPDY, HTTP compression is an essential technology that can't by replaced or discarded without inflicting considerable pain on both website operators and end users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At their Black Hat demo, the researchers will release a collection of tools that will help developers assess how vulnerable their applications and online services are to BREACH attacks. Most mitigations will be application-specific. In other cases, the attacks may give rise to new &quot;best practices&quot; advice on how to avoid including certain types of sensitive data in encrypted Web responses. Most websites already list only the last four digits of a customer's credit card number; BREACH may force websites to truncate other sensitive strings as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We expect that it could be leveraged in particular situations, maybe with an intelligence agency, or maybe an individual actor or a malicious crime organization might use this in a targeted scenario,&quot; Prado said. &quot;Any malware writer today has the ability to do something like this if they have not been doing it already.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
    		&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bradley Manning will learn today whether he will spend the rest of his life in prison, when a military judge announces her decision in the trial of the former intelligence analyst.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, is expected to give her verdict at 1pm on Tuesday. Manning faces 21 counts including espionage, computer fraud and theft charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most serious charge &amp;#x2013; that he knowingly &quot;aided the enemy&quot; by transmitting intelligence to WikiLeaks &amp;#x2013; carries a possible sentence of life in a military prison without the chance of parole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the eight-week trial, which ended on Friday, the US government has argued that Manning knew he was helping al-Qaida when he released more than 700,000 documents to WikiLeaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manning's legal team has sought to depict Manning as a naive but well-intentioned young man, who was motivated by deep Humanist beliefs and who wanted to prompt a debate within US society about the costs of war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debate has also centered over whether WikiLeaks is a journalistic organisation, in the same manner as the New York Times or the Guardian, who published key revelations. Lind's verdict could have potentially serious implications for the future of investigative journalism in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
